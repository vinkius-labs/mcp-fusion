## [3.14.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

#### `@vurb/core` — OAuth 2.0 BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)

Marketplace buyers can now authenticate with OAuth 2.0 providers (Calendly, Salesforce, Slack, Zoom, etc.) using their own OAuth credentials — orchestrated entirely by the platform, with zero MCP server code changes.

- **`'oauth2'` credential type** — New value in the `CredentialType` union. When a credential field uses `type: 'oauth2'`, the platform takes over the full token lifecycle: initiation, code exchange, encrypted storage, proactive refresh, and runtime injection.
- **`OAuthConfig` interface** — Attached to a `CredentialDef` via `oauth?: OAuthConfig`. Declares the provider's OAuth endpoints, scopes, grant type, and field references:
  - `provider` — Display name ("Connect with {provider}")
  - `grant_type` — `'authorization_code'` (default) or `'client_credentials'`
  - `authorize_url` — Provider's consent screen URL (auth code only)
  - `token_url` — Token exchange endpoint
  - `scopes` — Required OAuth scopes
  - `client_id_field` / `client_secret_field` — References to buyer's credential keys
  - `user_info_url` / `user_info_email_path` — Optional endpoint to show "Connected as {email}"
  - `token_expires_in` — Fallback TTL when provider doesn't return `expires_in`
  - `supports_refresh` — Whether provider returns refresh tokens
  - `extra_params` — Extra token request params (keys ending in `_field` resolved from buyer credentials)
- **`oauth?` on `CredentialDef`** — Optional field, only valid when `type: 'oauth2'`

### Example

```ts
export const credentials = defineCredentials({
  CALENDLY_ACCESS_TOKEN: {
    label: 'Calendly Access Token',
    description: 'Managed by the platform via OAuth.',
    type: 'oauth2',
    oauth: {
      provider: 'Calendly',
      authorize_url: 'https://auth.calendly.com/oauth/authorize',
      token_url: 'https://auth.calendly.com/oauth/token',
      scopes: ['default'],
      client_id_field: 'CALENDLY_CLIENT_ID',
      client_secret_field: 'CALENDLY_CLIENT_SECRET',
      user_info_url: 'https://api.calendly.com/users/me',
      user_info_email_path: 'resource.email',
    },
  },
  CALENDLY_CLIENT_ID: {
    label: 'Client ID',
    description: 'From your Calendly OAuth App.',
    type: 'string',
  },
  CALENDLY_CLIENT_SECRET: {
    label: 'Client Secret',
    description: 'From your Calendly OAuth App.',
    type: 'api_key',
  },
});
```

## [3.13.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Credential Schema Not Persisted on Deploy

- **`vurb deploy` now injects `credential_schema` into the manifest payload** — Servers using `defineCredentials()` correctly generated the credential schema during introspection, but the `commandDeploy` function never injected `result.credentials` into the `manifest` object before uploading. The backend (`EdgeDeployController`) reads `manifest.credentials` to persist the schema on the `mcp_servers` record, so all deployed servers had `credential_schema = null` in the database. Buyers subscribing to these servers never saw the "Authentication" setup tab because `credential_schema` was empty. Fixed by injecting `result.credentials` into the manifest when present. The `IntrospectResult` type now includes an optional `credentials` field.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

#### `@vurb/core` — Marketplace Prompt Examples

Publishers can now showcase realistic AI agent interactions directly in marketplace listings, giving buyers a clear preview of what the MCP server can do — before subscribing.

- **`promptExamples`** — New manifest field in `vurb.marketplace.json` for declaring conversational demos (user → agent exchanges). Each example has a `prompt` (what the user asks) and a `response` (what the agent replies), both supporting full i18n (`en`, `pt`, `es`, `fr`).
- **`MarketplacePromptExample` interface** — New type in `MarketplaceManifest.ts` with `I18nString`-capable `prompt` and `response` fields.
- **Normalizer support** — `normalizeMarketplacePayload()` extracts canonical `en` values and builds `prompt_i18n` / `response_i18n` maps for multilingual examples.
- **File-ref resolution** — `readMarketplaceManifest()` resolves `file:` references in prompt example fields, consistent with existing FAQ and long description behavior.

### Example

```json
{
  "promptExamples": [
    {
      "prompt": {
        "en": "What meetings do I have tomorrow?",
        "pt": "Quais reuniões tenho amanhã?"
      },
      "response": {
        "en": "You have 3 meetings tomorrow. 09:00 — Product Demo with Sarah Chen...",
        "pt": "Você tem 3 reuniões amanhã. 09:00 — Demo de Produto com Sarah Chen..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## [3.12.7] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Graceful Changelog File Reference

- **Missing `CHANGELOG.md` no longer blocks marketplace sync** — When `vurb.marketplace.json` references `"changelog": "file:CHANGELOG.md"` but the file does not exist, `readMarketplaceManifest()` previously threw, causing the entire marketplace payload to be set to `null`. The deploy succeeded (edge bundle was uploaded) but the listing was never created or updated. Now the changelog field is silently dropped and the rest of the manifest (title, descriptions, FAQs, integration, tags) is sent normally. A missing changelog is a cosmetic omission, not a deployment blocker.

## [3.12.6] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Resilient esbuild Discovery (4-Strategy Resolution)

- **`resolveEsbuild()` replaces blind `npm install`** — Projects with `tsx` + `vitest` have conflicting pinned esbuild versions (`~0.27` vs `0.21`), causing `npm install -D esbuild` to fail with `ERESOLVE`. The new `resolveEsbuild()` function tries 4 strategies in order:
  1. Direct ESM `import('esbuild')`
  2. CJS `createRequire` from project root (bypasses ESM cache)
  3. **Transitive discovery** — finds esbuild nested inside `tsx`, `vite`, or `vitest` `node_modules`
  4. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` as last resort

- **Shared between `validate` and `deploy`** — Both commands now use the same `resolveEsbuild()` from `introspect.ts`, eliminating duplicated esbuild resolution logic.

## [3.12.5] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — esbuild Auto-install: ESM Resolution Cache Bypass

- **`createRequire()` replaces `import()` after esbuild auto-install** — Node.js ESM caches resolution failures per specifier. After `import('esbuild')` fails (esbuild not installed), the runtime caches that failure. Even after `npm install -D esbuild` succeeds, a second `import('esbuild')` returns the cached error. The fix uses `createRequire()` from `node:module` anchored at the project root, which uses CJS resolution and does not cache ESM failures. Applied to both `introspect.ts` (validate) and `deploy.ts`.

## [3.12.4] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — esbuild Auto-install Uses Project Root

- **`vurb validate` esbuild auto-install now runs from the project root** — In v3.12.3, `runIntrospection()` ran `npm install -D esbuild` from `dirname(absEntry)` (e.g., `src/`), where no `package.json` exists. The function now accepts an optional `projectRoot` parameter, and `commandValidate` passes the correct `cwd`. Falls back to `dirname(absEntry)` if `projectRoot` is not provided.

## [3.12.3] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Introspection Pipeline Auto-installs esbuild

- **`vurb validate` and `vurb deploy` no longer fail when esbuild is missing** — The shared introspection pipeline (`runIntrospection()`) now auto-installs esbuild if the initial `import('esbuild')` fails. It runs `npm install -D esbuild` silently and retries, matching the existing auto-install pattern in `commandDeploy`. Previously, `vurb validate` failed with `Cannot find package 'esbuild'` in projects that didn't explicitly list esbuild as a devDependency.

## [3.12.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Resilient `vurb update`

- **`vurb update` no longer fails on freshly published versions** — Added `--prefer-online` to the `npm install` invocation to bypass stale npm cache metadata. Previously, `npm install @vurb/core@X.Y.Z` would fail with `ETARGET` immediately after a publish because npm's local cache still listed the old version as latest.
- **Automatic retry with per-package fallback** — If the batch `npm install` fails, the command retries once. If the retry also fails, it falls back to installing each package individually with per-package error reporting — partial updates succeed instead of all-or-nothing failure.
- **Reduced noise** — Added `--no-fund --no-audit` flags and increased timeout to 120s for batch installs.

## [3.12.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Edge Deploy Bundle Sanitizer

- **Framework-internal patterns no longer trigger server-side security scan** — `sanitizeBundleForEdge()` now transforms four additional patterns that are legitimately emitted by `@vurb/core` internals when bundled inline via esbuild. Previously, deploying any server that used `requireCredential()` or edge bridge APIs would fail with `bundle rejected by security scan` because the framework's own credential injection and edge bridge code matched the server-side static analysis regexes:
  - `__vinkius_secrets` → Unicode escape (`\u005f_vinkius_secrets`) breaks the `/__vinkius_secrets/` regex while remaining a valid JS identifier at V8 runtime
  - `process.env` → bracket notation (`process["env"]`) breaks the `/\bprocess\s*\.\s*env\b/` regex
  - `__vinkius_edge_` → Unicode escape (`\u005f_vinkius_edge_`) breaks the `/__vinkius_edge_/` regex
  - `globalThis[` → wrapped access (`(globalThis)/**/[`) breaks the `/globalThis\s*\[/` regex

## [3.12.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

#### `@vurb/core` — CLI Developer Experience Expansion

Four new CLI commands to bring the Vurb CLI to industry-standard developer experience and platform reliability.

- **`vurb version`** — Displays CLI version, Node.js/OS environment, and a table of all installed `@vurb/*` packages with their versions. Supports `-v` and `--version` shortcuts.
- **`vurb update`** — Automatically scans all `@vurb/*` packages, fetches the latest versions from the npm registry, and performs targeted `npm install` for outdated packages. Displays a clear before/after comparison table.
- **`vurb doctor`** — Comprehensive diagnostic suite that validates 8 environment checks: Node.js version (≥ 18), `@vurb/core` installation, `.vurbrc` configuration, deploy token validity (with live API probe), server entrypoint detection, esbuild availability, and `vurb.lock` status. Includes pass/warn/fail summary.
- **`vurb validate`** — Live server smoke test inspired by `terraform validate`. Boots the server via introspection (`VURB_INTROSPECT=1`), compiles contracts, and runs 7 validation checks: entrypoint resolution, esbuild build, server boot timing, tool registration audit (grouped vs flat), description coverage, schema parameter analysis, and lockfile drift detection via SHA-256 comparison.

#### Shared Infrastructure Modules

- **`npm-registry.ts`** — Centralized module for scanning declared and installed `@vurb/*` packages, fetching latest versions from the npm registry with timeout handling, and enriching package lists with registry data.
- **`introspect.ts`** — Shared introspection pipeline extracted from `deploy.ts`. Boots the server in non-transport mode, compiles `ToolContract` surfaces, generates lockfile manifests, and extracts tool entries (flat and grouped). Reused by both `vurb deploy` and `vurb validate`.

### Test Suite

- **`npm-registry.test.ts`** — 31 tests covering package scanning, version fetching, corrupt JSON, network errors, deduplication, and sorted results.
- **`version.test.ts`** — 11 tests covering arg parsing (`-v`, `--version`), output formatting, installed packages display, and empty directory handling.
- **`update.test.ts`** — 8 tests covering no-packages detection, all-up-to-date path, version mismatch indicators, and partial fetch failures.
- **`doctor.test.ts`** — 21 tests covering all 8 diagnostic checks with success and failure paths, API mocking, env vars, and missing dependencies.
- **`validate.test.ts`** — 48 deep tests with `vi.mock` on `runIntrospection` covering every code path: entrypoint resolution, boot failures (esbuild/timeout/generic/non-Error), tool analysis (zero/flat/grouped/descriptions/grammar/params), lockfile drift (missing/match/drift/SHA/corrupt), summary line formatting, and SHA-256 determinism.

## [3.11.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

#### `@vurb/core` — Deploy Bundle Size & Deduplication

- **Bundle size limit increased from 500KB to 1.5MB** — The previous 512KB limit was too restrictive for community-developed MCP servers that include standard third-party dependencies. All five size gates (CLI `MAX_BUNDLE_SIZE`, API controller `bundle`/`raw_size` validation, API service base64/raw guards) bumped in sync to 1,536,000 bytes (raw) / 2,100,000 bytes (base64).
- **MCP SDK deduplication** — `edgeStubPlugin()` now intercepts `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` imports and provides empty modules, preventing esbuild from bundling a second copy (~200KB saved). `@vurb/core` already bundles the SDK internally — user-listed copies are redundant.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

#### SaaS Integration Identity
- **`integration`** — New manifest block to declare which SaaS platform an MCP server wraps:
  - `name` — Platform name (e.g. "Acuity Scheduling")
  - `url` — Platform website
  - `description` — i18n-aware short description of what the SaaS does
  - `logoUrl` — Official SaaS logo for the listing card
- **`documentationUrl`** — Link to API/integration documentation
- **`supportUrl`** — Link to support channel
- **`sourceCodeUrl`** — Link to source code repository (trust signal for enterprise buyers)
- **`compatibility`** — MCP clients this server is tested with (e.g. `["claude-desktop", "cursor", "cline"]`)

#### Deploy Warnings
- **Non-blocking category warnings** — When a manifest includes category slugs that don't exist in the marketplace, `vurb deploy` now displays a `⚠ Warning` with guidance instead of silently dropping them. Deploys never fail for category mismatches.

### Changed
- `normalizeMarketplacePayload()` now maps all new integration fields from camelCase to snake_case for the deploy API payload.
- Deploy response type includes optional `warnings` array.

## [3.10.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

#### `@vurb/core` — Marketplace Behavioral Transparency

Vinkius Cloud now auto-computes a **Behavioral Trust Score** from the `CapabilityLockfile` (vurb.lock) at deploy time and exposes a public **Security Passport** on every marketplace listing — zero seller effort required.

- **Behavioral Trust Score** — Auto-computed from 10 lockfile signals (tool descriptions, entitlements, destructive action flags, middleware chain, cognitive guardrails, unbounded collections, schema field count, credential schema, integrity digest). Assigns a tier badge: 🏆 Gold (≥ 85) · 🥈 Silver (≥ 60) · 🥉 Bronze (≥ 40) · ⚪ Unrated (< 40).
- **Security Passport** — Public transparency tab rendered on every listing detail page. Displays entitlements grid (network, filesystem, subprocess, codeEvaluation), tool surface (count + destructive actions flagged), middleware chain, and cryptographic integrity digest — all auto-extracted from `vurb.lock`.
- **Publisher Type** — New `publisher_type` field (`official` | `partner` | `community`) at the MCP server level. Official and Partner status require admin verification after review.
- **i18n Marketplace Descriptions** — Sellers can now provide `short_description` and `long_description` in EN, PT, ES, and FR via a shared `I18nLangTabs` component. Canonical `en` field is maintained for backward compatibility.

### Changed

- **Listing Detail View** — Trust badge and publisher type badge rendered in the listing header alongside existing metadata.
- **Seller Dashboard** — Added a 5th stat card for Trust Score with tier emoji display.


## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

#### `@vurb/core` — BYOC Credentials System (Bring Your Own Credentials)

A new first-class API enabling marketplace-publishable MCP servers to declare and consume per-buyer credentials securely, without ever touching the seller's code or secrets.

- **`defineCredentials(schema)`** — Declare what credentials your server needs. The Vinkius marketplace reads this at introspect/deploy time and prompts the buyer to configure credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords, OAuth, connection strings, custom) before activation. Supports 9 credential types across 3 categories: `api_key`, `token`, `password`, `connection_string`, `uri`, `hostname`, `json_config`, `certificate`, `custom`.
- **`requireCredential(name, options?)`** — Read a credential at runtime. On Vinkius Cloud Edge, secrets are injected by the runtime before the first tool call via `globalThis.__vinkius_secrets`. Locally (stdio/HTTP), falls back to env vars (configurable via `contextFactory`) or a provided `fallback`.
- **`CredentialSchema`** — Type-safe credential descriptor with `type`, `label`, `description`, `required`, `placeholder` fields, plus `sensitive` (masked in UI/logs) and `validation.pattern` (regex pre-check).
- **`CredentialsContext`** — Runtime credential map with typed `get(name)` accessor.
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** — Seller's server code never sees raw buyer credentials; the runtime injects them into an isolated `globalThis.__vinkius_secrets` object per-request.

### Security

- **Server-side credential injection scanner** (`@vurb/core`) — `vurb deploy` server now runs a static analysis pipeline that rejects bundles attempting to intercept or exfiltrate the credential injection mechanism. Blocked patterns include: direct access to `__vinkius_secrets`, `globalThis.*secrets*`, `process.env`, `Object.keys(globalThis)`, `JSON.stringify(globalThis)`, and related patterns. Returns HTTP 422 with structured `violations[]` response. Client-side scanning was removed — the server is the authoritative security boundary.
- **CLI violation display** — `vurb deploy` now parses 422 responses and presents a structured violations list to the developer with actionable messages, instead of a raw HTTP error.

### Test Suite

- **`credentials.test.ts`** (`@vurb/core`) — New test file covering `defineCredentials` schema registration, `requireCredential` runtime resolution (secrets injection, env fallback, provided fallback, missing required), and `CredentialsContext` typed access.

## [3.8.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- **Introspection action expansion** (`@vurb/core`) — `vurb deploy` now correctly expands grouped tools into individual action entries for both the CLI output and the dashboard sync payload. A namespace like `compliance` with actions `obligations`, `timeline`, and `generate_report` now reports three separate entries (`compliance.obligations`, `compliance.timeline`, `compliance.generate_report`). Flat tools with a single action remain unchanged. The previous implementation incorrectly cast `LockfileToolSurface.actions` (`readonly string[]`) to a `Record` type, causing a TS2352 build error; now uses the pre-lockfile `contracts` (`ToolContract.surface.actions`) which carries per-action `ActionContract` with description fields.
- **Deploy success banner styling** (`@vurb/core`) — The success line is now plain white text with only the elapsed time highlighted in green, replacing the previous magenta/dim/bold mix.

## [3.8.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **`resources/list` handler computed at boot instead of per-request** (`@vurb/core`) — `registerResourceHandlers` registered the resource list via an IIFE, computing it once at `attachToServer()` time. Resources registered or removed from `ResourceRegistry` after initialization were never reflected in subsequent `resources/list` responses. Fixed by wrapping the list computation in an arrow function that is called on every request.

- **Variable shadowing: `signal` redeclared inside FHP block** (`@vurb/core`) — Inside `createToolCallHandler`, the outer `signal` (extracted at the top of the handler) was shadowed by a new `const signal` declaration inside the FHP handoff block. Renamed the inner variable to `handoffSignal` for clarity and to avoid potential misuse during future refactors.

- **`SwarmGateway.hasActiveHandoff` returned `false` during `connecting` phase** (`@vurb/swarm`) — When a handoff was activating but not yet fully connected, `hasActiveHandoff()` returned `false` (it only matched `status === 'active'`). This caused `ServerAttachment` to skip the `proxyToolsCall` path entirely, routing the LLM's tool call to the local gateway instead of returning the correct `HANDOFF_CONNECTING` error. Fixed by using `_sessions.has(sessionId)` — `proxyToolsCall` already handles `connecting` sessions correctly with a descriptive retry error.

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

#### `@vurb/swarm` — Federated Handoff Protocol (new package)

A new first-class package implementing the **Federated Handoff Protocol (FHP)**: a production-ready multi-agent orchestration layer that lets a single gateway MCP server dynamically hand off LLM sessions to specialist upstream micro-servers — and bring them back — without the LLM losing context.

- **`SwarmGateway` — Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA)**
  - External face (UAS): MCP server for the LLM client (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)
  - Internal face (UAC): MCP client tunnelling to upstream specialists
  - Session lifecycle: `activateHandoff()` → `proxyToolsList()` → `proxyToolsCall()` → `returnToGateway()`
  - Domain registry: maps logical names (`finance`, `devops`) to upstream URIs (`http://specialist:8081`)
  - Concurrent session management with configurable `maxSessions` cap (default: 100) — excess activations rejected with `SESSION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`
  - Automatic `dispose()` on shutdown cleanly closes all active tunnels

- **`UpstreamMcpClient` — Outbound MCP tunnel**
  - Dual transport: SSE (persistent, streaming) or Streamable HTTP (stateless, edge-compatible); auto-selected based on runtime
  - Connect timeout with `AbortSignal` cascade — closing the parent MCP connection aborts the upstream tunnel
  - Idle timeout closes zombie tunnels after configurable inactivity (default: 5 min)
  - Concurrent tool call tracking suspends the idle timer during active calls
  - `ProgressForwarder` pipes `notifications/progress` and `notifications/message` from upstream back to the LLM client

- **`NamespaceRewriter` — Transparent namespace isolation**
  - All upstream tools transparently prefixed with their domain: `listInvoices` → `finance.listInvoices`
  - Prefix stripped before forwarding to upstream — LLM never sees the raw name
  - `NamespaceError` thrown for prefix mismatches, preventing cross-domain routing

- **`ReturnTripInjector` — LLM escape hatch**
  - Injects a virtual `gateway.return_to_triage` tool into every upstream tools list
  - Without it, the LLM would be trapped in the specialist domain — restarting the conversation was the only escape
  - Deduplicates against rogue upstream tools with the same name (gateway's canonical version wins)
  - `formatSafeReturn()` anti-IPI sanitiser for return summaries from potentially compromised upstreams:
    - HTML-escapes `<`, `>`, `&`
    - Blocks `[SYSTEM]` / `[SISTEMA]` patterns
    - Hard-truncates at 2000 characters
    - Wraps in `<upstream_report source="…" trusted="false">` XML envelope

- **Zero-trust delegation token flow (`@vurb/core` integration)**
  - `mintDelegationToken()` — HMAC-SHA256 signed payload: `iss`, `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, `tid`, optional `traceparent`
  - Claim-Check pattern: carry-over state > 2 KB is stored in `HandoffStateStore`; only the UUID key travels in the token
  - `requireGatewayClearance` middleware for upstream servers: verifies HMAC, checks expiry, hydrates carry-over state via atomic one-shot read

- **Distributed tracing (W3C Trace Context)**
  - W3C `traceparent` (`00-{traceId}-{spanId}-01`) generated per handoff via `crypto.randomUUID()`
  - Propagated to upstream via `traceparent` HTTP header and embedded in the delegation token
  - Accessible on upstream via `ctx.traceparent` — correlates gateway ↔ specialist spans in any OpenTelemetry backend

#### `@vurb/core` — FHP security hardening

- **`EXPIRED_DELEGATION_TOKEN` error on missing Claim-Check state** — `verifyDelegationToken()` previously silently removed `state_id` and continued when the corresponding state was not found in the store (expired or already consumed). Now throws explicitly with `EXPIRED_DELEGATION_TOKEN`, enforcing fail-fast semantics and preventing silent context loss.

- **`HandoffStateStore` — atomic `getAndDelete` interface** — The store interface now supports an optional atomic `getAndDelete(id)` method. When present, it is used in preference to the two-phase `get` + `delete` path, guaranteeing true one-shot token consumption under concurrent requests (e.g. Redis `GETDEL`, Cloudflare KV with metadata).

- **`InMemoryHandoffStateStore`** — default in-process store suitable for single-instance deployments; uses two-phase `get` + `delete` (state is never irrecoverably lost on in-process crash, but concurrent requests can both succeed — documented behaviour).

#### `@vurb/cloudflare` and `@vurb/vercel` — test coverage

- Added `"test": "vitest run"` script and `vitest` devDependency to both adapter packages. Existing test files (`waitUntilCleanup-bug103.test.ts`, `VercelAdapter.test.ts`, `contextFactoryGuard-bug89.test.ts`) were already present but were not executed by `npm test --workspaces`.

### Fixed

- **`DelegationToken.ts` — silent state loss on replay/expiry** (`@vurb/core`) — When `state_id` was present in token claims but the state was not found in the store (already consumed or TTL-expired), the old code silently deleted `state_id` from claims and continued. A replayed token would be accepted with partial context, allowing unintended downstream access. Fixed: explicit `EXPIRED_DELEGATION_TOKEN` rejection.

### Security

- **One-shot Claim-Check guarantee** — Delegation tokens carrying large state via the Claim-Check pattern are now strictly one-shot: the first verification atomically reads and deletes the state; all subsequent verifications receive `EXPIRED_DELEGATION_TOKEN`. Under concurrent requests with an atomic store, exactly one verification succeeds.

- **Anti-IPI boundary on return summaries** — Upstream return summaries (via `gateway.return_to_triage`) are sanitised before being relayed to the LLM, preventing a compromised specialist from injecting instructions into the gateway's prompt context.

- **Session limit enforcement** — `SwarmGateway.maxSessions` counts both `connecting` and `active` sessions, preventing bypass attacks where an attacker opens `maxSessions` connecting tunnels before opening more.

### Test Suite

- **New package: `@vurb/swarm`** — 7 test files, 158 tests covering:
  - `SwarmGateway` full lifecycle (activation, proxy, return, dispose)
  - `NamespaceRewriter` prefix/unprefix and `NamespaceError`
  - `ReturnTripInjector` injection, deduplication, and `formatSafeReturn` anti-IPI
  - `UpstreamMcpClient` connect timeout, idle timeout, signal cascade, progress forwarding
  - Concurrent session activation and session limit enforcement
  - Token replay and expiry rejection end-to-end

- **`DelegationToken.deep.test.ts`** (`@vurb/core`) — 5 new tests:
  - Minimal atomic store (exercises the `getAndDelete`-only code path)
  - First/second verification with atomic store (one-shot via `getAndDelete`)
  - Pre-deleted state → `EXPIRED_DELEGATION_TOKEN`
  - Concurrent verification with atomic store: exactly 1 succeeds, 1 rejected
  - Concurrent verification with two-phase store: both succeed (documented behaviour); third call correctly rejected

- **`@vurb/cloudflare`** — 1 file, 3 tests (previously not executed)
- **`@vurb/vercel`** — 2 files, 26 tests (previously not executed)


## [3.7.13] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed

- **`StateMachineGate.transition()` race with XState subscriber (Bug #1)** — `transition()` read `_currentState` immediately after `actor.send()`, before the XState `subscribe()` callback had a chance to update it. The result was `transition.changed === false` even when the FSM state had genuinely changed, causing FSM snapshots to not be persisted to `fsmStore`/`fsmMemorySnapshots` and `notifications/tools/list_changed` to not be emitted. Fixed by adding `await Promise.resolve()` after `actor.send()` to flush pending microtasks (including the subscribe callback) before reading `_currentState`.

- **`SandboxEngine.execute()` — context undefined in abort handler (Bug #2)** — The `onAbort` closure captured the `context` variable before it was assigned via `await isolate.createContext()`. When `activeExecutions > 1` and the abort signal fired during context creation, `context` was still `undefined`, so `context?.release()` was a no-op — the script continued running until its timeout (up to 5s) instead of being interrupted immediately. Fixed by introducing a mutable `ctxRef` wrapper object created before `onAbort`, populated immediately after `createContext()`. The handler now calls `ctxRef.current?.release()`, always seeing the latest context reference.

- **`BuildPipeline` — ToolResponse shape heuristic false-positive (Bug #3)** — The fallback shape-based detection for `ToolResponse` in `wrappedHandler` could incorrectly identify domain objects matching `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: '...' }], isError?: boolean }` as framework responses, causing them to bypass `success()` wrapping and the Presenter pipeline (silent data loss). Fixed by removing the shape heuristic entirely. Only the `TOOL_RESPONSE_BRAND` symbol (stamped by all framework helpers — `success()`, `error()`, `toolError()`, `required()`, `toonSuccess()`) is now trusted for identification.

- **`recompile()` cache fast-path — O(n) loop per request (Bug #4)** — The exposition cache in `ServerAttachment` (introduced in Bug #7 fix) used a dirty flag for O(1) invalidation but still executed a `for...of` loop over `registry.getBuilders()` on every cache hit to count builders as a safety net for late-registered tools. `ToolRegistry` already exposes `get size(): number` backed by `Map.size` — always O(1). Fixed by reading `registry.size` directly and removing the loop. Added `readonly size: number` to the `RegistryDelegate` interface to formalize the contract without a type cast.

### Test Suite

- **7 new regression tests** in `StateMachineGate.transition-race.test.ts` — Verifies `changed` flag correctness after `actor.send()`, sequential transition chain, `onTransition` callback ordering, and restore-then-transition path.
- **5 new regression tests** in `SandboxAbortContextRef.test.ts` — Covers pre-aborted signal, abort during heavy computation (verifies elapsed < 3s), engine reusability after partial abort (concurrent executions), and `activeExecutions` counter cleanup.
- **13 new regression tests** in `BuildPipeline.toolresponse-brand.test.ts` — Covers domain objects with exact ToolResponse shape, `isError` variant, all branded helpers (`success`, `error`, `toolError`, `required`, `toonSuccess`), raw string/object/null/undefined wrapping, and `TOOL_RESPONSE_BRAND` non-enumerability in JSON.

## [3.7.12] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **`autoDiscover` name-based dedup blocks router action merging (Bug #129)** — When a single file exports multiple action builders from the same router (e.g., `issues.query('list')`, `issues.mutation('ignore')`), all builders return the same `getName()` value (the router name). The dedup logic used `Set<string>` keyed by `getName()`, so only the first alphabetical builder was registered and the rest were silently skipped. For a router with 7 actions, only 1 was visible to the LLM. Fixed by changing dedup from name-based (`Set<string>`) to reference-based (`Set<ToolBuilderLike>`), which correctly prevents the same builder object from being registered twice while allowing different builders sharing the same router name to reach `ToolRegistry.register()` where `mergeActions()` handles the merge.

### Test Suite

- **3 new regression tests** in `autoDiscoverRouterDedup-bug129.test.ts` — Same-name different-object builders all registered, same-reference dedup still works, split-file routers merge correctly.

## [3.7.11] - 2026-03-20

### Tests

- **`ConcurrencyGuard` — full unit test suite (new file)** — Added 25 tests covering: fast-path slot acquisition, FIFO drain order, load shedding under zero-queue and full-queue conditions, idempotent release (double-call does not corrupt active count or spuriously drain), `AbortSignal` semantics (pre-aborted, abort while queued, abort listener cleanup on normal resolution), fractional `maxActive`/`maxQueue` clamping, high-throughput 50-task scenario, and `createConcurrencyGuard` factory.
- **`PolicyEngine` — extended coverage** — Added 12 tests: `**` glob matching all tool names, specific policy shadowed by earlier `**`, frozen resolved objects (mutation attempt throws), match-only policy inheriting default `cacheControl`, empty policy array with/without defaults, exact-name near-miss non-matching, and ordering semantics of no-op vs later specific policies.
- **`EgressGuard` — boundary and double-suffix tests** — Added 8 tests: exactly-at-limit returns same reference, exactly-1-byte-over triggers truncation, multi-block where first fits and second is truncated (using limits above `MIN_PAYLOAD_BYTES`), double-suffix protection (intervention marker appears exactly once even when input already contains it).
- **`defineModel` — `toApi()` and runtime `infer` tests** — Added 9 tests: `toApi()` with no aliases (pass-through), single and multiple field aliases, unknown keys pass-through, `undefined` value stripping, empty input, and assertion that `model.infer` is `undefined` at runtime (type-only trick).
- **`MutationSerializer` — isolation and abort edge cases** — Added 8 tests: distinct keys execute independently (no cross-chain blocking), GC of one key does not affect another, error in key-A does not block key-B, aborting a signal while the fn is already running does not cancel the in-flight call, sequential calls after an aborted queued call resume correctly.
- **`ProxyHandler` — extended HTTP and error coverage** — Added 13 tests: multiple `:param` placeholders in one URL, error message includes endpoint pattern when param is missing, `undefined` param value throws, unwrap of `{ data: null }` / `{ data: 0 }` / `{ data: false }` / `{ data: [] }` (falsy but defined), all four HTTP methods with path-param stripping and remainder forwarding.

## [3.7.10] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **`defineModel` — shared `fieldTypeToZod` compiler** — Extracted a private `fieldTypeToZod(def, childCompiler)` helper and `labelFor(def)` util to eliminate ~50 lines of duplicated `switch/case` logic that existed independently in both `compileField` (output schema) and `compileFieldForInput` (tool input schema). Both functions now delegate to the shared base, making type mappings a single source of truth.
- **`FluentToolBuilder` — `withDesc()` schema helper** — Introduced a module-level `withDesc<T extends ZodType>(schema, description?)` helper that applies `.describe()` only when a description is provided. Replaced the repeated `description ? z.X().describe(description) : z.X()` ternary across all 20+ `with*()` and `withOptional*()` methods (scalar, bulk, enum, array variants). Bulk array methods (`withArrays`, `withOptionalArrays`) now also create the base array schema once outside the loop.
- **`ProxyHandler` — HTTP dispatch table** — Replaced the `switch/case` over HTTP methods with a typed `HTTP_DISPATCH` lookup object (`Record<'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE', Dispatcher>`). Added an early guard for missing URL path parameters — previously a missing `:param` value was silently coerced to an empty string; now throws a descriptive error naming the exact `with*()` call needed to fix it.
- **`ConcurrencyGuard` — remove unsafe `readonly` cast** — `PendingWaiter.resolve` was declared `readonly` but the abort-listener cleanup code was forced to mutate it via `(waiter as { resolve: () => void }).resolve = ...`. Changed the field to mutable (with a comment explaining the intent) and removed the illegal type assertion.
- **`MutationSerializer` — cooperative abort during queue wait** — The previous implementation checked `signal.aborted` only *after* `await prev` resolved. A cancellation that fired while the caller was waiting behind a long mutation was silently ignored until the predecessor finished. Now uses `Promise.race([prev, abortPromise])` so the wait is interrupted immediately on abort. The abort event listener is cleaned up when `prev` resolves normally to prevent memory leaks.
- **`EgressGuard` — type-safe truncation suffix** — Replaced the `TRUNCATION_SUFFIX` string constant (with an implicit `{limit}` placeholder substituted via `.replace()`) with a `buildTruncationSuffix(formattedLimit: string)` function. The limit value is now a typed required argument, making the contract explicit and eliminating a class of silent template errors.

## [3.7.9] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`vurb remote --server-id` overwrites existing remote URL** — Running `vurb remote --server-id <uuid>` without an explicit `--remote` URL would overwrite the existing remote (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`) with the default production URL (`https://cloud.vinkius.com`), causing deploy failures with "unexpected non-JSON response". Now only writes the `remote` key when the user explicitly provides a URL; otherwise preserves the existing value from `.vurbrc`.
- **`vurb token` does not update `serverId`** — Setting a new token via `vurb token <value>` saved the token but left the old `serverId` in `.vurbrc`. When the new token belonged to a different server, subsequent `vurb deploy` failed with "connection token does not belong to this server". Now auto-resolves `serverId` by calling `GET /api/token/info` with the new token and updating `.vurbrc` automatically.

## [3.7.7] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Build fix for action expansion** — Fixed TS2352 in `deploy.ts` caused by casting `LockfileToolSurface.actions` (which is `readonly string[]`) to a `Record<string, ...>`. Now uses the pre-lockfile `contracts` object (`ToolContract.surface.actions`) which has per-action `ActionContract` with description fields, providing both correct types and richer data.

## [3.7.6] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Introspection action expansion** — `vurb deploy` now lists individual actions for grouped tools in both the CLI output and dashboard sync payload. A grouped namespace like `compliance` with actions `obligations`, `timeline`, `generate_report` now correctly reports 3 entries (`compliance.obligations`, `compliance.timeline`, `compliance.generate_report`) instead of a single `compliance`. Flat tools (single action) remain unchanged.
- **Deploy success line styling** — Simplified the success banner to clean white text with only the elapsed time highlighted in green.

## [3.7.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Node-compatible introspection build** — `vurb deploy` introspection now uses a separate esbuild pass (`platform: 'node'`, `format: 'esm'`) instead of re-executing the edge bundle. The edge bundle stubs Node builtins via `edgeStubPlugin` (e.g. `os.tmpdir` → noop), which caused `(0, an.tmpdir) is not a function` when running introspection locally. The second build is near-instant since esbuild is already loaded.

## [3.7.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **IIFE introspection via `vm.runInThisContext`** — `vurb deploy` introspection was failing with `Unexpected token '['` because the esbuild bundle (format: `iife`) was being imported as ESM (`.mjs`). Replaced `import()` with `vm.runInThisContext()` to correctly evaluate the IIFE in the current process context. Uses the original unsanitized bundle since edge sanitization is only needed for the deploy payload.

## [3.7.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Test assertions for namespace merge** — Updated 5 test files (`TypedRegistry`, `AdversarialQA`, `EndToEnd`, `LargeScaleScenarios`, `TypeSafety`) to align with the namespace merge behavior introduced in v3.7.1. Tests that expected `already registered` errors for same-name builders with different actions now correctly verify that merge succeeds, while duplicate action keys within the same namespace still throw `Duplicate action`.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **ToolRegistry namespace merge** — `registry.register()` now merges actions from builders that share the same namespace (e.g. `f.query('compliance.obligations')` and `f.query('compliance.timeline')` in separate files). Previously threw `Tool "compliance" is already registered`.
- **Bundle-based introspection** — `vurb deploy` introspection now imports the pre-compiled esbuild bundle directly instead of re-importing source `.ts` files through tsx. Near-instant evaluation, no TypeScript compilation overhead. Timeout reduced from 10s to 5s.

## [3.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **ToolRegistry namespace merge** — `registry.register()` now merges actions from builders that share the same namespace (e.g. `f.query('compliance.obligations')` and `f.query('compliance.timeline')` in separate files). Previously threw `Tool "compliance" is already registered`. Duplicate action keys within the same namespace still throw.
- **Test assertions for `target` field** — Updated `create.test.ts` and `create.e2e.test.ts` assertions to include the `target: 'node'` property returned by `collectConfig`.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Deploy Manifest — Cryptographic Deploy Signature** — `vurb deploy` now generates a fresh **lockfile manifest** on every deploy using the real introspection system (`compileContracts` + `generateLockfile`). The manifest is the deploy's cryptographic signature — same SHA-256 behavioral digests as `vurb lock`. Sent with the deploy payload and stored per-deployment on the backend for audit trail.
- **`VURB_INTROSPECT` mode in `startServer()`** — When the CLI sets `process.env.VURB_INTROSPECT=1`, `startServer()` captures the registry and tool definitions, resolves a `globalThis` promise, and returns immediately without starting any transport. Enables CLI introspection without side effects.
- **Tool sync during deploy** — Tools are now synced to the dashboard immediately during deploy via `ToolSyncService`, eliminating the need to wait for runtime boot.
- **Premium deploy output** — Redesigned CLI output with brand-forward "Vinkius Edge" header, MCP Server Stateful label, tool listing with descriptions, and manifest signature confirmation.

### Removed

- **Regex-based tool introspection** — The fragile `introspectToolsFromBundle()` regex scanner has been removed entirely. Tool discovery now uses the same real introspection pipeline as `vurb lock`.

## [3.6.10] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`vurb deploy` — Bundle sanitizer for edge static analysis** — The deploy server rejects bundles containing `eval()`, `new Function()`, `__proto__`, `Object.setPrototypeOf` etc. These patterns appear legitimately in esbuild output (CJS interop, class transpilation) and third-party SDKs (Zod, MCP SDK). Added `sanitizeBundleForEdge()` post-bundle step that neutralizes each pattern without changing JS semantics (indirect eval, bracket notation, etc.). Server security stays intact — V8 isolate sandbox is the real boundary.

### Test Suite

- 12 new sanitizer tests in `deployEdgeStub-bug151.test.ts`:
  - Per-pattern neutralization against exact server regexes
  - Safe code passthrough
  - Multi-violation bundle handling

## [3.6.8] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- **`vurb deploy` — Cannot find module 'vurb' (Bug #151)** — `edgeStubAliases()` used `createRequire().resolve('vurb')` to locate `edge-stub.js`, but the package is published as `@vurb/core`, and its `exports` map only defines the `"import"` (ESM) condition — making CJS `require.resolve` fail even with the correct name. Replaced with `fileURLToPath(new URL('../../edge-stub.js', import.meta.url))`, a relative path that requires no external resolution.
- **`vurb deploy` — esbuild alias prefix matching** — esbuild `alias` does prefix matching: aliasing `fs` → `edge-stub.js` turned `fs/promises` → `edge-stub.js/promises`. Replaced with esbuild plugin (onResolve + onLoad) using CJS Proxy catch-all for named imports not in edge-stub.js.
- **`token.ts` exactOptionalPropertyTypes violation** — `writeVurbRc(cwd, { token: undefined })` violated `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`. Replaced with destructuring rest `const { token: _, ...rest } = config` to omit the key cleanly.
- **Dead `dirname` import in `deploy.ts`** — Removed unused `dirname` from `node:path` import after the resolution refactor.
- **Flaky JWT clock tolerance test** — `JwtVerifier.edge.test.ts` boundary test used real time with 1s margin, failing on slow CI. Fixed with `vi.useFakeTimers()` for deterministic execution.

### Added

- **CLI `token` command** — `vurb token <value>`, `vurb token --clear`, `vurb token` (show status). `tokenValue` and `clearToken` fields in `CliArgs`.

### Test Suite

- 32 regression tests in `deployEdgeStub-bug151.test.ts`:
  - Source analysis, regex coverage for ALL builtinModules
  - 2 real esbuild integration tests (17 node:* imports including subpaths)
  - 12 sanitizer tests against exact server-side static analysis regexes


## [3.6.6] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **`ErrorUtils.toErrorMessage()` utility** — Centralized error message extraction from unknown `catch` values, replacing 15 scattered `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` instances across 10 files. Supports `Error` objects, plain strings, objects with `.message`, and arbitrary values.
- **`ObservabilityHooks.ts` module** — Extracted `_buildDebugHooks`, `_buildTracedHooks`, `_buildTelemetryHooks` factory functions and `extractXmlTag`/`extractXmlActions` helpers from `GroupedToolBuilder.ts` into a dedicated observability module. Reduces `GroupedToolBuilder.ts` from 1552 to 1283 lines and improves Single Responsibility Principle adherence.

### Changed

- **`GovernanceObserver` deduplication** — Extracted shared span/event emission logic from `observe()` and `observeAsync()` into a `finalize()` helper and a `startSpan()` helper, eliminating ~60 lines of duplicated code between the two methods.
- **`ServerAttachment` helper extraction** — Extracted FSM clone/restore logic into `cloneAndRestoreFsm()` and session ID resolution into `resolveSessionId()`, reducing file size from 1425 to 1312 lines.
- **Unused imports cleanup** — Removed 8 unused type imports from `GovernanceObserver.ts` (`VurbAttributeValue`, `ToolContract`, `CapabilityLockfile`, `LockfileCheckResult`, `GenerateLockfileOptions`, `ServerDigest`, `AttestationResult`, `EntitlementReport`, `StaticTokenProfile`, `ContractDiffResult`).
- **`eslint-disable` annotations** — All remaining `as any` casts now carry inline rationale comments explaining the type-safety boundary.
- **Empty catch blocks** — All empty `catch {}` blocks now include descriptive comments explaining why the error is intentionally swallowed.

### Refactored Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `GroupedToolBuilder.ts` | −270 lines (observability hooks → `ObservabilityHooks.ts`) |
| `GovernanceObserver.ts` | −40 lines (dedup `observe`/`observeAsync`, unused imports) |
| `ServerAttachment.ts` | −113 lines (FSM helpers extracted) |
| `ExecutionPipeline.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `DevServer.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `SandboxEngine.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `HydrationSandbox.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `RedactEngine.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `JudgeChain.ts` | `toErrorMessage` integration |
| `dev.ts` (CLI) | `toErrorMessage` integration |

## [3.6.5] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **RateLimiter cleanup interval never auto-destroyed** — `destroy()` is now required in the `RateLimitStore` interface. The `rateLimit()` factory returns a `RateLimitMiddleware` with an exposed `destroy()` method that forwards to the underlying store. Prevents phantom timer accumulation in test suites and long-running processes.
- **HTTP session Map grows indefinitely on connection drops** — Added `sessionActivity` tracking with periodic reaper interval (default: every 5 min) that removes sessions inactive beyond `sessionTtlMs` (default: 30 min). New `sessionTtlMs` and `sessionReapIntervalMs` options in `StartServerOptions`. Prevents memory leaks from abandoned TCP connections (kill -9, network timeouts).
- **DevServer ESM cache-bust not surfaced to setup callback** — The `setup` callback now receives a `DevServerSetupContext` with `registry` and `cacheBustUrl` properties (backward-compatible via duck typing). A one-time ESM warning is emitted on the first file-change reload to guide developers toward using cache-busted imports.

### Added

- `RateLimitMiddleware` type — middleware function with `destroy()` lifecycle method
- `DevServerSetupContext` type — context passed to dev server setup callbacks
- `sessionTtlMs` / `sessionReapIntervalMs` options in `StartServerOptions`

### Test Suite

- 25 new regression tests across 3 test files:
  - `RateLimiter.destroy-bug11.test.ts` — 9 tests: destroy lifecycle, timer leak prevention, custom store forwarding
  - `SessionTtl-bug12.test.ts` — 6 tests: TTL configuration API, defaults, option composition
  - `DevServerCacheBust-bug13.test.ts` — 13 tests: setup context, backward compat, ESM warning, cacheBustUrl utility
  - Cumulative: 5625 tests passing across 278 files

## [3.6.4] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **`extractLastJson` brace-in-string edge case** — Replaced backward brace counting with try-parse from each `{` position. The previous algorithm treated `{` and `}` inside JSON string values as structural, causing extraction failures for valid JSON like `{"reason": "has } in it", "safe": true}`.
- **Exposition recompile O(N) per request** — Replaced `builders.every((b, i) => b === cached[i])` identity comparison (O(N) on every `tools/call`) with a dirty-flag cache plus lightweight builder-count safety net. Steady-state cost is now O(1).
- **Consensus strategy `failOpen` bypass** — In consensus mode, adapter errors (timeout, crash) are now treated as implicit rejections regardless of `failOpen`. The "ALL must agree" contract was violated when `failOpen: true` allowed content through with only 1/3 judges succeeding.
- **PII leak when `structuredClone` fails** — `compileRedactor()` now throws an explicit error instead of silently returning unredacted data when `structuredClone` fails on non-cloneable objects (Socket, ReadStream, WeakRef). PII is never exposed on the wire.
- **XState import cached as permanent failure** — `loadXState()` now retries failed imports up to 3 times instead of caching the first failure permanently. Handles transient filesystem errors on edge/serverless cold starts gracefully.

### Test Suite

- 50 new regression tests across 5 test files:
  - `ExtractLastJson-bug6.test.ts` — 12 tests: braces inside strings, nested objects, multiple JSON blocks, LLM response patterns
  - `ExpositionCache-bug7.test.ts` — 8 tests: O(N) comparison overhead, dirty-flag cache, invalidation, late-registered builder detection
  - `ConsensusFailOpen-bug8.test.ts` — 9 tests: consensus error rejection, fallback strategy unaffected, result metadata
  - `RedactPiiLeak-bug9.test.ts` — 7 tests: throw on clone failure, PII leak prevention, normal redaction unchanged
  - `XStateCachedFailure-bug10.test.ts` — 7 tests: retry on failure, max attempts, cached success, reset integration
  - Cumulative: 5600 tests passing across 275 files

## [3.6.3] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **FSM session leak via static `'__default__'` key (Bug #3)** — `extractSessionId()` fallback changed from a shared `'__default__'` string to a per-attachment `crypto.randomUUID()`. Multiple stdio clients connected to the same server no longer share FSM state. Prevents one client from inheriting another client's state transitions.
- **Zombie generator handlers on slow I/O (Bug #4)** — `drainGenerator()` now uses `Promise.race([gen.next(), abortPromise])` to honor `AbortSignal` cancellation in real-time during each yield. Previously, generators blocked on slow I/O (DB queries, network) would continue executing as zombies after client disconnect.
- **RedactEngine lazy-import race condition (Bug #5)** — `loadFastRedact()` now uses a `_loadPromise` gate to serialize concurrent callers. Previously, concurrent Presenter boot calls could both pass the null-check, trigger duplicate `import('fast-redact')` calls, and non-deterministically overwrite each other's result.

### Test Suite

- 30 new regression tests across 3 test files:
  - `FsmSessionLeak-bug3.test.ts` — 11 tests: session collision prevention, UUID isolation, per-attachment consistency
  - `DrainGeneratorZombie-bug4.test.ts` — 9 tests: real-time cancellation during slow I/O, pre-aborted signals, error propagation
  - `RedactEngineRace-bug5.test.ts` — 10 tests: concurrent import serialization, error handling, integration with `initRedactEngine()`

## [3.6.2] - 2026-03-17

### Security

- **HTTP body size limit — DoS/OOM prevention (Bug #149)** — The HTTP transport handler now enforces a configurable `maxBodyBytes` limit (default: 4MB). Requests exceeding the limit are rejected with HTTP 413 via dual-layer protection: Content-Length pre-flight check and streaming byte counter with `req.destroy()`. Prevents attackers from sending multi-GB payloads that crash the server with Out-of-Memory.
- **Prompt injection via markdown code fence escape (Bug #150)** — `buildInputFirewallPrompt()` and `buildFirewallPrompt()` now sanitize backticks in user-controlled data to `\u0060` before embedding in markdown code fences. Previously, arguments or rules containing triple backticks could escape the code block and inject arbitrary instructions into the LLM judge prompt, forcing it to return `{"safe": true}` and bypassing the security firewall entirely.
- **Greedy JSON extraction replaced (Bug #150)** — `parseJudgePass()` and `extractDetailedRejections()` now use a new `extractLastJson()` function that scans backward from the last `}` with brace-depth counting, replacing the greedy regex `/\{[\s\S]*\}/` which captured from the FIRST `{` to the LAST `}` including non-JSON prose between them.

### Added

- `maxBodyBytes` option in `StartServerOptions` for configurable HTTP body size limit
- `extractLastJson()` utility for robust JSON extraction from LLM responses (internal)

### Test Suite

- 198 new adversarial security tests across 6 test files:
  - `HttpBodyLimit-bug149.test.ts` — 6 regression tests for body size limit
  - `PromptInjectionFence-bug150.test.ts` — 11 regression tests for fence escape + JSON extraction
  - `extractLastJson-adversarial.test.ts` — 50 tests: multi-object ambiguity, nesting stress, braces inside strings, attack vectors, realistic LLM responses, performance
  - `InputFirewall-adversarial.test.ts` — 50 tests: backtick injection, fence escape patterns, key name injection, unicode bypasses, nested data, compound attacks
  - `PromptFirewall-adversarial.test.ts` — 47 tests: fence escapes in rules, distributed attacks, unicode bypasses, markdown injection, compound payloads
  - `HttpBodyLimit-adversarial.test.ts` — 34 tests: Content-Length manipulation, streaming guard, boundary conditions, multi-byte chars, MCP payloads, trickle attacks

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Model Layer — `defineModel()` API** — Declarative domain model definition with type-safe casts, fillable profiles, and API alias mapping. Models compile to Zod schemas and serve as the single source of truth for tool parameters, Presenter validation, and API field aliasing:
  - `defineModel({ name, casts, input, output })` — define fields with types, descriptions, and optionality
  - `FieldDef` factory (`FieldDef.string()`, `.number()`, `.boolean()`, `.enum()`, `.date()`, `.array()`) with `.optional()`, `.describe()`, `.default()` chaining
  - `ModelBuilder` — fluent model definition with `.field()`, `.casts()`, `.fillable()`, `.visible()`
  - Fillable profiles for `create`, `update`, `filter` — control which fields are accepted per operation
  - `.toApi()` output alias mapping — maps internal field names to external API field names
- **`.fromModel(model, operation)`** on `FluentToolBuilder` — derive tool input parameters from a Model's fillable profile, eliminating manual `.withString()` / `.withNumber()` duplication
- **`.proxy(endpoint, options?)`** on `FluentToolBuilder` — auto-generate HTTP proxy handlers that derive method from semantic verb (`query` → GET, `mutation` → POST), pass model input as query params or body, and unwrap `response.data` by default. Supports path params (`:uuid`), forced method override, and unwrap toggle
- **`Presenter.schema(model)`** — accepts a `defineModel()` Model directly, extracting its compiled Zod schema without the redundant `.schema(Model.schema)` pattern
- **`definePresenter({ schema: Model })`** — declarative API also accepts Model objects with automatic Zod schema extraction and `.describe()` auto-rules
- **E-commerce example** — full-stack MCP server example with 4 tool domains (product, order, user, system), 4 Presenters, JWT auth middleware, in-memory DB, prompts, and tests

### Changed

- **`FluentToolBuilder` decomposed** — extracted `BuildPipeline.ts` (tool compilation), `ProxyHandler.ts` (HTTP proxy logic), and `SemanticDefaults.ts` (verb defaults) from the 1100-line monolith. Zero public API changes — all re-exports preserved for backward compatibility
- **`FluentToolBuilder._addParam()` safety** — duplicate check now uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` instead of `in` operator, preventing prototype pollution false positives
- **`FluentToolBuilder` type sentinel** — `TInput` default changed from `void` to `Record<string, never>` for correct conditional type resolution in `.handle()` and `.resolve()`
- **`.returns()` covariance** — accepts `Presenter<any>` instead of `Presenter<unknown>`, eliminating forced casting when the Presenter type differs from the tool's context type
- **Scaffold templates updated** — generated projects now use `@vurb/core` (correct npm package name) instead of `vurb`, include `models/` directory with `SystemModel.ts`, and Presenter templates reference Model schemas
- **Documentation overhaul** — homepage redesign with new hero, theme, and navigation; MCP server frameworks comparison blog post; copy edits across introduction, quickstart, MVA pattern, building tools, presenter, middleware, and comparison pages
- **`Presenter.makeAsync()` truncation fix** — async callbacks now operate on the same truncated dataset the sync pipeline used, preventing inconsistent data when `agentLimit` is active

### Fixed

- **`AuditTrail` error code extraction (Bug #11)** — status detection now parses the `code` XML attribute (`code="RATE_LIMITED"`) instead of substring-matching the full error text, preventing false positives when error messages contain `RATE_LIMITED` or `INPUT_REJECTED` as substrings
- **`RateLimiter` empty window `resetMs` (Bug #8)** — when all timestamps are pruned from the window, `resetMs` is now `0` (window already reset) instead of the full `windowMs` duration, giving accurate retry-after headers
- **`StateMachineGate.init()` race condition (Bug #6)** — concurrent `init()` calls now serialize via a shared `_initPromise`, preventing duplicate XState actor creation and leaked actors
- **`ResourceRegistry._matchesTemplate()` regex injection (Bug #5)** — static URI segments are now escaped before regex compilation, preventing `.`, `+`, `*` in URIs from being interpreted as regex metacharacters
- **`SandboxGuard` false positive on `.async` property access (Bug #12)** — `containsAsyncKeyword()` now uses a negative lookbehind (`(?<!\.)\basync\b`) to exclude `data.async` or `obj.async` from triggering the async keyword rejection
- **`SandboxGuard.stripStringLiterals()` comment stripping** — now also strips `//` line comments and `/* */` block comments before scanning for keywords, preventing comment content from triggering false positives
- **`ServerAttachment` introspection + resources overwrite (Bug #4)** — when both `introspection` and `resources` are configured, the introspection manifest is now merged into `registerResourceHandlers` instead of registering a separate `setRequestHandler` that overwrites the resource handler
- **`ServerAttachment` FSM auto-bind flat name (Bug #9)** — single-action default tools now use the bare tool name (matching `ExpositionCompiler.compileFlat` behavior) instead of appending `_default`
- **`TelemetryBus` socket chmod race** — `chmodSync(0o600)` now runs inside the `server.listen()` callback, eliminating the window where the socket is world-readable between bind and permission change
- **`PresenterPipeline` redactor write-back** — lazy-compiled redactors are now propagated back to the Presenter instance via `writeBackRedactor()`, preventing redundant recompilation on subsequent `make()` calls
- **Scaffold `package.json` package name** — generated dependency now correctly references `@vurb/core` instead of `vurb`

### Test Suite

- Updated `create.e2e.test.ts` and `create.test.ts` for Model-aware scaffold output (file count, assertions)
- Updated `PresenterBatch2.test.ts` for truncation-aware `makeAsync()` behavior
- Updated `RedactEngine.test.ts` for write-back redactor propagation
- Updated `ResourceSubscription.test.ts` for escaped template matching
- Updated `SandboxGuard.test.ts` for comment-aware stripping and property access exclusion
- Updated `IntrospectionIntegration.test.ts` for merged resource + introspection handlers

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Bulk Parameter Declaration — 10 new `with*()` methods** for reduced verbosity when tools have many parameters of the same type:
  - `.withStrings({ name: 'description', ... })` — multiple required strings in one call
  - `.withOptionalStrings({ name: 'description', ... })` — multiple optional strings
  - `.withNumbers({ ... })` / `.withOptionalNumbers({ ... })` — bulk number parameters
  - `.withBooleans({ ... })` / `.withOptionalBooleans({ ... })` — bulk boolean parameters
  - `.withEnums({ name: [values, description?], ... })` / `.withOptionalEnums({ ... })` — bulk enum parameters with per-field allowed values
  - `.withArrays(itemType, { name: 'description', ... })` / `.withOptionalArrays(itemType, { ... })` — bulk array parameters sharing the same item type
  - All bulk methods preserve full TypeScript type-chaining — `input` is correctly typed inside `.handle()`
  - Duplicate parameter detection via `_addParam()` works identically to singular methods

### Documentation

- **`llms.txt`** — Bulk with*() Methods section with reference table, before/after example, and API signatures
- **`building-tools.md`** — Bulk Parameter Declaration subsection in Parameter Declaration with usage examples and comparison

## [3.3.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Security Layer — 5 composable middleware modules** for production AI security:
  - **`InputFirewall`** — LLM-as-Judge ingress scanner. Evaluates tool arguments for SQL injection, prompt injection, command injection, and path traversal before handler execution. Configurable judge model, severity thresholds, and bypass allowlists.
  - **`PromptFirewall`** — Evaluates system rules against a judge LLM before they reach the agent. Detects rule conflicts, data exfiltration attempts, and prompt override patterns. Rejects or sanitizes suspect rules.
  - **`AuditTrail`** — SOC2/GDPR-compliant invocation logger. Records identity, tool name, action, SHA-256 args hash, status, duration, and timestamps. Pluggable sink (console, file, external SIEM). Configurable `extractIdentity` for JWT/session resolution.
  - **`RateLimiter`** — Token-bucket rate limiting per identity. Configurable `maxRequests`, `windowMs`, and `keyExtractor`. Returns structured `toolError('RATE_LIMITED')` with `retryAfter` and upgrade hints.
  - **`JudgeChain`** — Multi-model consensus evaluation. Fans out to N judge LLMs, aggregates verdicts (unanimous, majority, weighted), and produces a final allow/deny decision with confidence score.
- **Resource Subscriptions** — `ResourceBuilder`, `ResourceRegistry`, and `SubscriptionManager` for MCP resource subscriptions with `notifications/resources/updated` emission. Fluent builder API: `.uri()`, `.name()`, `.mimeType()`, `.subscribe()`, `.unsubscribe()`, `.notify()`.
- **Blog engine** — VitePress-integrated blog with tag filtering, author links, and SEO:
  - `BlogIndex.vue` — Blog listing page with hero section, tag-based filtering, article cards
  - `BlogPostHeader.vue` — Clickable tags linking to filtered views, author GitHub link
  - `posts.data.mts` — Frontmatter data loader with `authorUrl` support
  - 3 blog posts: *Introducing Vurb.ts*, *MVA Pattern Deep Dive*, *Anatomy of an AI Platform Breach*
- **Security analysis article** — *"Anatomy of an AI Platform Breach: How Vurb.ts Would Have Defended Every Attack Vector"*: 9 vulnerability vectors mapped to Vurb.ts defenses with real code examples, Executive Summary for CISOs, Compliance Mapping table (SOC2/GDPR/ISO 27001, 14 controls), Recommended Security Posture playbook (4 priorities with effort estimates)
- **Security Layer documentation** — 6 new doc pages: overview, InputFirewall, PromptFirewall, AuditTrail, RateLimiter, JudgeChain
- **Resource Subscriptions documentation** — Dedicated doc page with Fluent API examples

### Changed

- **Vurb.ts rebrand** — All references to "MCP Fusion" updated to "Vurb.ts" across `config.mts` (title, meta tags, JSON-LD, codeRepository), `seo.ts`, blog posts, and README links
- **Header** — Logo-only navbar using S3-hosted Vurb.ts wordmark PNG (48px), subtitle removed, `siteTitle: false`
- **GitHub links** — All repository URLs updated from `vinkius-labs/mcp-fusion` to `vinkius-labs/vurb.ts`

## [3.3.3] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`TelemetryCollector` module** — Extracted `emitPresenterTelemetry()` from `PostProcessor.ts`, consolidating `presenter.slice`, `presenter.rules`, and `dlp.redact` event emission into a dedicated, testable module. PostProcessor reduced from 185 to ~115 lines.
- **Mutation Presenter convention** — JSDoc `@example` in `definePresenter()` documenting the recommended pattern for create/update/delete confirmation flows with `suggestActions`.

### Changed

- **`PresenterPipeline` — decomposed god class** — Extracted 7 pure step functions (`stepTruncate`, `stepValidate`, `stepRedact`, `stepEmbeds`, `stepUiBlocks`, `stepRules`, `stepSuggestions`) + `executePipeline()` orchestrator into `PresenterPipeline.ts`. `Presenter.make()` now delegates entirely via `_toSnapshot()`. `Presenter.ts` reduced from 1219 to ~1030 lines. Zero public API changes — all existing tests pass unmodified.
- **`PresenterSnapshot<T>` interface** — Read-only configuration snapshot enabling standalone, testable step functions without exposing private Presenter state.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`UiBlockMeta` — layout hints for UI blocks** — Optional `meta` parameter on all 8 `ui.*` helpers (`echarts`, `mermaid`, `markdown`, `codeBlock`, `table`, `list`, `json`, `summary`) with `title`, `width`, and `priority` fields. Metadata is rendered as XML attributes on `<ui_passthrough>` wrappers. Fully backward-compatible — blocks without meta produce identical output.
- **`extendPresenter()` — Presenter composition** — Create a new Presenter by merging a base config with overrides. Rules are merged additively (static arrays concatenated, dynamic functions chained). Schema, UI, name, and suggestions use the override when defined. Embeds and `redactPII` paths are merged. Async callbacks use override-wins strategy.
- **`makeAsync()` — asynchronous callback support** — New method returning `Promise<ResponseBuilder>` that enriches the sync `make()` output with async callbacks. Four fluent methods: `.asyncUiBlocks()`, `.asyncCollectionUiBlocks()`, `.asyncRules()`, `.asyncSuggestActions()`. Introspection via `hasAsyncCallbacks()`. Sync `make()` remains unchanged (zero breaking changes).
- **`PresenterConfig` async fields** — Declarative `asyncUi`, `asyncCollectionUi`, `asyncRules`, `asyncSuggestActions` config fields wired in `definePresenter()` and `extendPresenter()`.
- **43 new tests** — Comprehensive coverage for UiBlockMeta (13), `extendPresenter()` (11), and `makeAsync()` (19) with edge cases: null filtering, collection mode, method chaining, sync/async output parity, config inheritance.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`collectionSuggestActions()` / `collectionSuggest()`** — HATEOAS-style action suggestions at the collection level. Callback receives the full `T[]` array, enabling aggregate suggestions (batch operations, bulk approvals). When both per-item and collection suggestions are configured, `collectionSuggestActions` takes priority for arrays.
- **`collectionRules()`** — collection-level system rules evaluated with the entire validated array. Supports static `string[]` or dynamic `(items[], ctx?) => (string | null)[]`. Merged additively with per-item rules.
- **`definePresenter()` config fields** — `collectionSuggestions` and `collectionRules` for the declarative API, wired to the corresponding fluent methods.
- **25 new tests** — edge cases: empty arrays, context forwarding, agentLimit combo, single-item arrays, priority over per-item callbacks, deduplication of embed rules across collection items.

### Fixed

- **`_attachSuggestions()` evaluated only the first array item** — `suggestActions()` on collections now correctly falls back to the first item only when `collectionSuggestActions` is not configured.
- **`_attachRules()` dynamic rules evaluated only the first array item** — per-item dynamic rules behavior is preserved; new `collectionRules` provides aggregate-level rules.
- **`_processEmbeds()` processed only the first array item** — child Presenter embeds now iterate all items in a collection. Rules are deduplicated via `Set<string>`, UI blocks emitted only for the first item to prevent context window explosion.


## [3.1.31] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `SandboxGuard` now rejects `eval()` and `new Function()` at the fail-fast level with actionable LLM feedback — previously these passed through to V8 where they produce confusing or silent failures (Bug #139)
- `GroupedToolBuilder.getSandboxConfig()` JSDoc now explicitly documents that this accessor is metadata-only and does NOT auto-create a `SandboxEngine` — prevents false impression that config drives runtime behavior (Bug #140)
- `f.sandbox()` factory now tracks engine lifecycle via `FinalizationRegistry` — emits a `console.warn` when a `SandboxEngine` is garbage-collected without `.dispose()`, surfacing native V8 Isolate memory leaks (Bug #141)
- `SandboxEngine` abort handler now releases the per-request `Context` when concurrent executions prevent full isolate disposal — reduces cancellation delay from timeout-bounded to near-instant in multi-execution scenarios (Bug #142)

## [3.1.30] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `SandboxEngine._emitTelemetry()` no longer uses `as any` — the telemetry event object is now typed as `SandboxExecEvent`, restoring compile-time safety against interface drift (Bug #134)
- `SandboxEngine.execute()` now returns `INVALID_DATA` (new error code) when `ExternalCopy(data)` fails due to non-serializable values (functions, Symbols, WeakRefs) — previously misclassified as `RUNTIME` (Bug #135)
- `SandboxGuard` async detection now scans the entire code body (after stripping string literals) instead of only the start — nested `async` IIFEs and callbacks are now caught with accurate feedback (Bug #136)
- `resetIvmCache()` exported from `SandboxEngine` for test mock/unmock cycles — previously, a failed `require('isolated-vm')` permanently cached `null` with no way to retry (Bug #137)
- `TextEncoder` hoisted to module-level constant `TEXT_ENCODER` — previously allocated per `execute()` call (Bug #138)

## [3.1.29] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `SandboxEngine.execute()` now rejects code exceeding 64 KB (`MAX_CODE_LENGTH = 65 536`) before spawning an isolate — previously, arbitrarily large payloads were forwarded to V8, risking host-side OOM (Bug #132)
- `SandboxEngine` now emits telemetry for `OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE` results via `_emitTelemetry()` — previously, the early-return path skipped the telemetry call, creating a blind spot in observability (Bug #133)
- `FluentToolBuilder` branded `ToolResponse` cast now uses an intermediate `unknown` to satisfy TS2352 under strict mode
- `ServerAttachment` debug warnFn now passes `error` as `string` (matching `ErrorEvent` interface) and includes the required `step` and `timestamp` fields
- `StateSyncBuilder._cachedLayer` field declaration now includes explicit `| undefined` to satisfy `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`

## [3.1.28] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `autoDiscover()` now deduplicates discovered tool builders by tool name — previously, a directory containing both `index.ts` and a barrel re-export could register the same tool twice
- `VurbClient` fluent proxy now guards `Symbol.toPrimitive`, `Symbol.toStringTag`, `Symbol.iterator`, `Symbol.asyncIterator`, `Symbol.hasInstance`, and `nodejs.util.inspect.custom` — previously, debugging tools and `util.inspect()` triggered unexpected recursive proxy traversal
- `ExpositionCompiler.buildAtomicSchema()` no longer emits `console.warn()` in production when action schema fields overlap common schema fields — diagnostic warnings are now routed through the optional `onWarn` callback (wired to the debug observer in `ServerAttachment`)

### Changed

- `llms.txt`: Updated stale peer dependency versions from `^2.0.0` to `^3.0.0` for Cloudflare and Vercel adapters
- `llms.txt`: Added deduplication-by-tool-name mention to `autoDiscover()` documentation

## [3.1.27] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `GroupedToolBuilder.action()` now rejects empty/whitespace-only action names at registration — previously accepted `''`, creating unreachable discriminator values
- `ExecutionPipeline.parseDiscriminator` now returns `INVALID_DISCRIMINATOR` when the `action` field is present but not a string — previously reported `MISSING_DISCRIMINATOR`, masking the actual type error
- `PromptRegistry.clear()` now also clears interceptors and cancels pending debounce timers — previously only cleared the prompt map, leaving stale interceptors and timers active
- `FluentToolBuilder._addParam()` now rejects duplicate parameter names with a clear error — previously last-write-wins silently overwrote the first definition
- `FluentRouter.use()` now returns a type-narrowed `FluentRouter<TContext & TDerived>` when used with `MiddlewareDefinition` — previously returned `this` without narrowing, causing type erasure of derived context
- `injectLoopbackDispatcher` now returns `TContext & LoopbackContext` — previously typed as `TContext`, hiding the `invokeTool` property from prompt handlers
- `FluentToolBuilder` constructor now rejects empty/whitespace-only tool names — previously accepted `''`, creating invalid tools per MCP spec
- `FluentToolBuilder._addParam()` now rejects empty/whitespace-only param names — previously accepted `''`, producing invalid JSON Schema
- `FluentToolBuilder.handle()` now throws on double-invocation — previously allowed calling `.handle()` twice on the same builder without error
- `FluentToolBuilder.annotations()` now merges with existing annotations — previously replaced the entire object, losing prior keys
- `ActionGroupBuilder.action()` 2-arg shorthand now validates handler is a function — previously used `!` non-null assertion, risking undefined handler in dynamic construction
- `FluentRouter._createBuilder()` description fallback no longer has dead `!builder._description` branch — the conditional was always true since the builder is freshly created
- `FluentToolBuilder` ToolResponse auto-detection now uses a `TOOL_RESPONSE_BRAND` symbol for reliable identification — previously relied solely on a structural heuristic that could false-positive on domain data with `{ content: [{ type: 'text' }] }` shape
- `DevServer` recursive `fs.watch()` now emits a warning on Linux with Node.js < 20 where recursive watching is unsupported — previously failed silently, missing file changes in subdirectories

## [3.1.26] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `FluentToolBuilder` now rejects tool names with more than one dot-separated segment (e.g. `'admin.users.list'`) at build time — previously parsed only the first dot, producing a malformed action name that crashed `GroupedToolBuilder`
- `ContextDerivation` (`defineMiddleware`) now blocks `constructor` and `prototype` keys alongside `__proto__` — previously only `__proto__` was guarded, inconsistent with the inline middleware path in `FluentToolBuilder` which blocks all three
- `PromptRegistry` `prependSystem()` and `appendSystem()` interceptor helpers now emit `role: 'user'` — previously used `role: 'assistant'`, making the LLM believe it had already produced the injected system content
- `GroupedToolBuilder.action()` now throws on duplicate action names — previously silently pushed a second entry with the same key, creating a dead-code handler behind an ambiguous discriminator enum
- `FluentPromptBuilder.tags()` now appends via `push(...tags)` — previously replaced the entire array on each call, so `.tags('a').tags('b')` yielded `['b']` instead of `['a', 'b']`
- `StateSyncBuilder.layer` getter now caches the built `StateSyncLayer` instance and invalidates on mutation — previously called `this.build()` on every access, returning a new object each time (`sync.layer === sync.layer` was `false`)

## [3.1.25] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `ServerAttachment` `createToolCallHandler` now enforces the FSM State Gate at dispatch — previously only filtered `tools/list`, allowing clients that knew a tool's name to bypass the gate and call it regardless of FSM state; rejected calls return a structured `toolError('FORBIDDEN')` with current state, blocked tool name, and available actions
- `ServerAttachment` in-memory FSM snapshot store now uses a bounded LRU map (max 10 000 entries) — previously used an unbounded `Map` that never evicted entries, causing linear memory growth proportional to unique session count in long-running servers

## [3.1.24] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `ApiKeyManager._timingSafeCompare` now uses constant-time XOR accumulation over both buffers — previously early-returned on length mismatch, leaking key length via timing side-channel
- `MiddlewareCompiler.isAsyncGeneratorFunction` now includes a duck-type fallback checking `Symbol.asyncIterator` on the function prototype — previously only checked `Symbol.toStringTag` and `constructor.name`, which fail for transpiled async generators
- `PromptRegistry.listPrompts` cursor fallback now skips to end of list when cursor target is removed — previously used lexicographic `>` comparison on insertion-ordered Map keys, which could return incorrect pages

## [3.1.23] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `.env` parser (`loadEnv`) now strips inline comments (`KEY=value # comment` → `value`) for unquoted values and only removes matching quote pairs — previously inline `#` was kept verbatim and mismatched quotes (e.g. `'bar"`) were independently stripped
- `Vurb.ts_VERSION` now reads from `package.json` at runtime via `createRequire` — previously hardcoded as `'1.1.0'`, causing stale version in CLI output and lockfile digests
- `VurbTester.callAction()` now places the discriminator (`action`) **after** the user-provided args spread — previously placed it before, allowing user args `{ action: 'override' }` to shadow the programmatic discriminator
- Inspector `Simulator` now emits exactly **one** `execute` event per pipeline — previously emitted an unconditional first `execute` plus a second inside the if/else branches, doubling `callCount` and live-traffic entries
- `autoDiscover` `walkDir()` now sorts directory entries alphabetically via `localeCompare` — previously returned files in filesystem-dependent order, causing non-deterministic tool registration across OS/deploys
- Cloudflare adapter now uses `ctx.waitUntil(server.close())` for non-blocking cleanup — previously used `finally { await server.close() }`, which delayed every response until cleanup completed

## [3.1.22] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `prisma-gen` `emitFindUnique()` now generates `findUnique` + null-check returning an error response — previously used `findUniqueOrThrow`, which leaked Prisma's opaque `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` (P2025) to the LLM
- `PromptRegistry` interceptor builder `prependSystem` and `appendSystem` now use `role: 'assistant'` — previously all four methods used `role: 'user'`, making system/user insertion functionally identical
- `materializeContract()` now integrates `EntitlementScanner` to populate real handler entitlements from static source analysis — previously returned hardcoded all-false placeholder, leaving downstream blast-radius analysis blind
- `profileResponse()` overhead token slice now uses `.slice(-overheadBlocks)` to correctly measure trailing overhead blocks — previously sliced from the beginning, inverting data and overhead counts
- `scaffold()` now skips the generic RBAC `auth.ts` push when `vector === 'oauth'` — previously wrote it twice (generic first, then OAuth-specific), causing wasted I/O and inflated progress count
- CLI `parseArgs` now validates that flag-value arguments (`--server`, `--name`, `--cwd`, `--transport`, `--vector`, `--dir`, `--token`, `--server-id`) are followed by an actual value — previously consumed the next flag silently (e.g. `--server --dir ./src` set server to `"--dir"`)
- `ask()` now listens for the readline `close` event and resolves with the fallback value — previously, if stdin was piped or closed (Ctrl+D/EOF), the returned Promise would hang forever

## [3.1.21] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- `validateArgs` now strips the `_select` framework field in the no-schema early-return path — previously leaked to handlers when no Zod validation schema was defined
- `ServerAttachment` now caches the `compileExposition()` result across requests — avoids redundant recompilation on every `tools/call` and `tools/list` when the builder set hasn't changed
- `DevServer` now calls `cacheBustUrl()` inside `invalidateModule()` and exports `cacheBustUrl` — previously defined but never invoked, ESM modules were served stale on hot-reload
- Cloudflare and Vercel adapters now wrap `contextFactory()` in try/catch — previously, a thrown error (auth failure, DB error) caused an uncaught exception and a generic 500 instead of a JSON-RPC error envelope
- AWS connector polling loop now has a re-entrancy guard — prevents concurrent `refresh()` calls when discovery takes longer than `pollInterval`

## [3.1.20] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- SSE server template now wraps the async HTTP handler body in `try/catch` — previously, a rejected promise from `server.connect()` or `transport.handlePostMessage()` would crash the generated server with an unhandled rejection
- `scaffold()` now cleans up the target directory when a write operation fails mid-way (e.g. permission denied, disk full) — partially-written project files are removed instead of left as broken orphans
- `Vurb.ts deploy` now prompts for user confirmation before auto-installing `esbuild` — previously ran `npm install -D esbuild` silently with `stdio: 'ignore'`, modifying `package.json` without consent
- `Vurb.ts deploy` now validates `serverId` format against `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` and applies `encodeURIComponent` — previously, a malicious `.vurbrc` with `serverId: "../../admin/nuke"` could traverse the API path
- `VurbClient` now accepts a `discriminatorKey` option (defaults to `'action'`) — previously hard-coded `action` as the key, breaking grouped tool calls when the server uses a custom discriminator like `.discriminator('command')`

## [3.1.19] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- CLI entry-point guard now handles Windows shim extensions (`.cmd`, `.ps1`, `.cjs`, `.mjs`, `.exe`) — previously `main()` was silently skipped when invoked via npx/pnpm/yarn on Windows
- `Vurb.ts dev` reload now resolves the new registry before clearing the old one — if resolution fails (e.g. syntax error in user code), existing tools remain available instead of vanishing
- `Vurb.ts deploy` now warns when the deploy token would be sent over plaintext HTTP, adds a 60-second fetch timeout, and wraps `res.json()` in try/catch for non-JSON responses
- FSM state gate now clones per-request even without an external `fsmStore` — concurrent SSE/stdio clients no longer share and mutate the same FSM instance, preventing cross-session workflow corruption
- `FluentToolBuilder` inline `.use()` middleware no longer merges enriched context via `Object.assign` — dangerous keys (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`) are now filtered to prevent prototype pollution

## [3.1.18] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- `TokenManager` now restricts file permissions on Windows via `icacls` — `mode: 0o600` is silently ignored on NTFS, so saved tokens and device codes were readable by any local user
- `ZodCompiler.compileArray()` now prefers `minItems`/`maxItems` over legacy `minLength`/`maxLength` for array constraints — previously emitted `.min()`/`.max()` based on string-level fields, producing incorrect validation for arrays
- `HttpHandlerFactory` no longer adds `Content-Type: application/json` to GET and HEAD requests — prevents servers from rejecting body-less requests that carry an unexpected content header
- `RefResolver` deep-clones `$ref` targets before recursive resolution — multiple `$ref` pointers to the same definition no longer share a single mutable object, preventing cross-contamination during in-place resolution
- `ToolSynthesizer.toToolName()` in the n8n package now throws when the sanitized name is empty (e.g. `"---"`, `"   "`) — previously returned `""`, which produced an invalid MCP tool definition

## [3.1.17] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- `SandboxEngine` abort handler no longer disposes the shared isolate when concurrent executions are in flight — prevents collateral `'Isolate was disposed'` errors misclassified as `MEMORY`
- `SandboxEngine` output size guard now uses UTF-8 byte length (`TextEncoder`) instead of `.length` (UTF-16 code units) — correctly rejects CJK/emoji output that exceeds `maxOutputBytes`
- `ExecutionPipeline` discriminator re-injection now guards against `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` names — prevents prototype pollution via poisoned discriminator configuration
- `EgressGuard` byte-level truncation now backtrack to a valid UTF-8 character boundary instead of producing U+FFFD replacement characters for incomplete multi-byte sequences
- `ToolRegistry.routeCall` no longer leaks all registered tool names in the "unknown tool" error response — prevents exposing tools hidden by tag-based filtering; suggests `tools/list` instead
- `JwtVerifier` now accepts an `algorithm` field in `JwtVerifierConfig` for public key verification — no longer hardcoded to `RS256`, enabling ES256/ES384/ES512 elliptic curve keys

## [3.1.16] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- `coercePromptArgs` no longer coerces empty string `""` to `0` for ZodNumber fields — leaves it unset so Zod correctly rejects it as missing
- `PromptRegistry.listPrompts` cursor now finds the nearest successor when the cursor target is removed between pages, preventing silent restart from page 1
- `isToolResponse` type guard now verifies that `content[0]` has a string `type` property, preventing domain objects with `content` arrays from bypassing the MVA pipeline
- `ServerAttachment` flat-mode tool dispatch reuses the exposition compiled for telemetry routing instead of calling `recompile()` twice per call
- `DevServer.invalidateModule` now recursively invalidates transitive CJS dependents (`require.cache` children), ensuring hot-reload propagates through import chains
- `DevServer` file watcher now registers an `'error'` handler to prevent unhandled `ENOSPC`/filesystem errors from crashing the process
- `StateMachineGate` now exports `resetXStateCache()` to allow test environments to re-trigger xstate dynamic import after mock changes

## [3.1.15] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`GovernanceObserver.observe()` sync mishandles async callbacks (Bug #50)** — `observe<T>(fn: () => T): T` accepted async callbacks since `() => Promise<T>` is assignable to `() => T`. The span ended immediately, `durationMs` was near-zero, async rejections were never caught, and the debug event registered success before async work completed. Fixed by adding a runtime guard that throws when the result is thenable, directing users to `observeAsync()`.

- **`VurbClient.terminalCall` — user `action` field overwrites routing field (Bug #51)** — `{ action: actionName, ...args }` placed the routing `action` before user args. If the user's schema had a field named `action`, the user's value silently overwrote the routing field, causing the server to route to the wrong handler. Fixed by inverting spread order to `{ ...args, action: actionName }`.

- **`Group.addChildGroup()` without cycle detection — infinite recursion (Bug #52)** — Adding a group as a child of itself or creating an indirect cycle caused infinite recursion in `getRoot()` and `getFullyQualifiedNameRecursive()`. Fixed by walking the parent chain before adding; if the child is an ancestor, throw.

- **`GroupItem.addParentGroup()` is public — allows inconsistent bidirectional links (Bug #53)** — `addParentGroup()` added a group to the item's `parentGroups` but did not add the item to the group's `childTools`. The two collections became inconsistent. Fixed by marking as `@internal` with documentation directing users to `Group.addChildTool()` / `addChildPrompt()` / `addChildResource()`.

- **`ExpositionCompiler` action schema silently overwrites common schema fields (Bug #54)** — When both common and action schemas defined a field with the same name, the action version silently won with no warning. Fixed by emitting `console.warn()` when an action field overwrites a common field.

- **`CryptoAttestation` top-level `await` breaks CommonJS consumers (Bug #55)** — `const subtle = globalThis.crypto?.subtle ?? (await import('node:crypto')).webcrypto.subtle` used top-level await, requiring ESM. The module failed to load in CJS contexts. Fixed by replacing with lazy async `getSubtle()` resolution per-call, following the same pattern as `canonicalize.ts`.

## [3.1.14] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`startServer` edge interceptor returns `server: null` typed as `Server` (Bug #45)** — In edge/interceptor mode (Vinkius Cloud V8 Isolate), `startServer` returned `{ server: null as any }`, hiding the null from TypeScript. Callers accessing `result.server.close()` crashed with null dereference. Fixed by changing `StartServerResult.server` type to `Server | null` and removing the `as any` cast.

- **`TokenEconomics` overhead ratio is 0 when ALL blocks are overhead (Bug #46)** — `overheadRatio = dataTokens > 0 ? overheadTokens / dataTokens : 0` reported 0 (minimum) when all blocks were overhead (100% overhead case), semantically inverting the metric. The `OVERHEAD WARNING` advisory never triggered for the most extreme case. Fixed by returning `Infinity` when `dataTokens === 0 && overheadTokens > 0`.

- **`ToolContract.materializeBehavior` fingerprint includes schema keys in condition gate (Bug #47)** — Condition `presenterSchemaKeys.size > 0 || staticRuleStrings.length > 0` caused the fingerprint to change from `'none'` to `'static:e3b0c44...'` (hash of empty string) when Presenter had schema keys but zero rules. Adding/removing schema keys changed the fingerprint without any rules changing. Fixed by checking only `staticRuleStrings.length > 0`.

- **Static rules silently discarded when dynamic rules coexist (Bug #48)** — When any action had `presenterHasContextualRules: true`, the fingerprint became `'dynamic'` and static rule hashing was skipped entirely. A tool with 2 static + 1 dynamic action lost cryptographic coverage of its static rules. Fixed by computing a composite fingerprint `'dynamic:<hash>'` that preserves static rule integrity alongside the dynamic indicator.

- **`TelemetryBus.close()` doesn't remove signal handlers — wrong function reference (Bug #49)** — Signal handlers were registered as anonymous arrow functions (`() => sigHandler('SIGINT')`) but `close()` tried to remove `sigHandler` directly — a different function reference. `removeListener` was a no-op, leaving stale handlers that could kill the process after explicit `close()`. Fixed by storing arrow function references in named variables and using those same references in both registration and removal.

## [3.1.13] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Auto-wrap `success(undefined)` produces malformed ToolResponse for void handlers (Bug #41)** — When a handler returns `void` (fire-and-forget pattern), `result` is `undefined`. The duck-type ToolResponse check failed, and `success(undefined)` was called, producing `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: undefined }] }` which violates the MCP contract (`text` must be a string). Fixed by guarding `if (result === undefined || result === null) return success('OK')` before the duck-type check.

- **`DevServer.performReload` collects builders in disposable registry (Bug #42)** — `performReload` created a local `reloadRegistry`, called `setup(reloadRegistry)`, collected builders, but never transferred them to the real MCP server's registry. The client received `notifications/tools/list_changed` but the actual tool list hadn't changed — hot-reload was effectively a no-op. Fixed by accepting an optional `registry` in `DevServerConfig` and transferring collected builders after each reload (with `clear()` before re-registration to avoid duplicates).

- **`selfHealing` option accepted but never used in `attachToServer` (Bug #43)** — `AttachOptions` declared `selfHealing?: SelfHealingConfig` and imported the type, but `attachToServer` never destructured or wired it into the handler pipeline. Users configuring `selfHealing` got zero effect. Fixed by destructuring `selfHealing`, adding it to `HandlerContext`, passing it through to `hCtx`, and calling `enrichValidationError` on error results in `createToolCallHandler`.

- **FSM state lost when `fsmStore` exists but session ID is not extractable (Bug #44)** — After FSM transition, state was saved to `fsmStore` only if `extractSessionId(extra)` returned a value. In stdio transports (no session ID), the transition was applied to the per-request clone and then discarded — state was silently lost. Fixed by using `extractSessionId(extra) ?? '__default__'` as a fallback session ID at all three call sites (tool list handler load, tool call handler load, post-transition save).

## [3.1.12] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`redactPII()` silently fails when `fast-redact` not loaded asynchronously (Bug #37)** — `compileRedactor()` called the synchronous `getFastRedact()` which returns `null` if the async `loadFastRedact()` hasn't completed yet. Presenters declared at module top-level (before `initVurb()`) received `_compiledRedactor = undefined` and PII passed to the wire without redaction or warning. Fixed by making `_applyRedaction` lazily retry compilation on first use and emitting a `console.warn` when redaction is configured but `fast-redact` remains unavailable.

- **`createGroup.execute()` discards validated/transformed Zod data (Bug #38)** — After `schema.safeParse(args)` succeeded, the handler was called with the raw `args` instead of `result.data`. Zod transforms (`.transform(Number)`), defaults (`.default('foo')`), and strip (`.strip()`) were silently discarded. Fixed by passing `result.data ?? args` to the handler chain.

- **`FluentEnum.default()` does not mark field as optional (Bug #39)** — `FluentString`, `FluentNumber`, and `FluentBoolean` all set `this._optional = true` in `.default()`, but `FluentEnum.default()` did not. The Zod schema remained `required` despite having a default, causing contradictory contracts for the LLM. Fixed by adding `this._optional = true` to `FluentEnum.default()`.

- **`FluentRouter.tags()` replaces instead of accumulating (Bug #40)** — Same pattern as Bug #11: `this._tags = tags` (assignment) instead of `this._tags.push(...tags)` (accumulation). Chaining `.tags('auth').tags('admin')` discarded `'auth'`. Fixed by changing to `this._tags.push(...tags)` consistent with `FluentToolBuilder` and `GroupedToolBuilder`.

## [3.1.11] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Case-sensitive boolean coercion in `PromptExecutionPipeline` (Bug #31)** — `value === 'true'` was case-sensitive, so `'True'`, `'TRUE'`, and `'1'` were all coerced to `false`. Fixed by using `value.toLowerCase() === 'true' || value === '1'` with a `typeof` guard.

- **Leading space in description when `tool.description` is `undefined` (Bug #32)** — `DescriptionDecorator` baked a space into the suffix constant, producing `" [Cache-Control: ...]"` when the base description was empty. Fixed by conditionally inserting the space only when `base.length > 0`.

- **`ZodDescriptionExtractor` fails to unwrap `ZodPipeline` (Bug #33)** — `ZodPipeline` stores its inner schema in `_def.in`, not in `innerType`/`type`/`schema`. The fallback chain returned `undefined`, silently losing `.describe()` annotations on piped fields. Fixed by adding `(def as Record<string, unknown>)['in']` to the fallback chain.

- **`autoDiscover` silently swallows all import errors (Bug #34)** — Syntax errors, missing dependencies, and runtime exceptions were all caught and ignored, making tools disappear without any diagnostic. Fixed by adding `onError` callback and `strict` option to `AutoDiscoverOptions`. When `strict` is `true`, errors are rethrown.

- **`edge-stub.ts` path functions return empty string silently (Bug #35)** — `resolve()`, `join()`, `dirname()`, and `basename()` returned `''` instead of crashing, allowing empty paths to silently propagate. Fixed by replacing them with `CRASH('node:path.<fn>')` calls for consistency with Tier 2 stubs.

- **`TokenEconomics` collection detection via `endsWith('s')` produces false positives (Bug #36)** — Fields like `status`, `address`, `progress`, `class`, and `success` were incorrectly classified as collections, inflating risk assessments. Fixed by replacing `endsWith('s')` with a specific regex of 20 known plural suffixes plus case-insensitive `includes('list')` and `includes('items')` checks.

## [3.1.10] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`.strict()` overrides consumer's unknown-keys policy in `createGroup` (Bug #24)** — Pre-computed `strictSchemaMap` unconditionally applied `.strict()` to all action schemas, overriding the consumer's choice of `.passthrough()` or `.strip()`. Fixed by removing `strictSchemaMap` and using the consumer's original schema from `schemaMap` directly.

- **`retryAfter` not validated for finite/positive values in `toolError` (Bug #25)** — `retryAfter` accepted `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-1`, and `0`, producing invalid XML like `<retry_after>NaN seconds</retry_after>`. Fixed by gating the tag emission with `Number.isFinite(retryAfter) && retryAfter > 0`.

- **`VurbClient` error text includes `"undefined"` for non-text content (Bug #26)** — `.map(c => c.text)` produced `undefined` for image/resource content blocks. Fixed by adding `.filter(c => c.type === 'text')` before `.map()` in `executeInternal()`.

- **`EgressGuard` missing truncation suffix at exact byte boundary (Bug #27)** — When a content block consumed exactly all remaining bytes, subsequent blocks were silently skipped without appending the truncation suffix. The response appeared complete to the LLM despite missing content. Fixed by checking after the loop whether blocks were skipped and appending the suffix to the last block.

- **`ContextDerivation` prototype pollution via `Object.assign` (Bug #28)** — `Object.assign(ctx, derived)` blindly copied all properties including `__proto__`. Replaced with explicit `Object.entries` loop that skips `__proto__` keys. Added documentation warning that `contextFactory` must return a new object per invocation to prevent cross-call property leakage.

- **Duck-type check false positive for domain objects with `content` array (Bug #29)** — The ToolResponse detection check only verified `content[0]?.type === 'text'`, allowing domain objects with a coincidental `content` array to bypass `success()` wrapping and the Presenter layer. Fixed by adding `Object.keys(result).every(k => k === 'content' || k === 'isError')` to reject objects with extra properties.

- **`ResponseBuilder` uses implicit falsy check for empty string (Bug #30)** — `data || 'OK'` relied on JavaScript's falsy semantics. Replaced with `data.length > 0 ? data : 'OK'` for explicit intent and to avoid confusion with the short-circuit pattern.

## [3.1.9] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Race condition in `CursorCodec.ensureSecret()` — concurrent calls generate different keys (Bug #17)** — When no explicit secret is provided, two concurrent `encode()` calls could both enter `ensureSecret()` before `_secretBytes` was set, generating different keys. The second would overwrite the first, invalidating earlier cursors. Fixed by adding a `_secretPromise` field as a promise-based lock — the first call creates the promise, subsequent concurrent calls reuse it.

- **`IntrospectionResource` passes `undefined as TContext` to RBAC filter (Bug #18)** — When `config.filter` was defined but `contextFactory` was absent, the filter was called with `undefined` force-cast as `TContext`. If the filter accessed `ctx.user.role`, it threw `TypeError`. Fixed by removing the `else if (config.filter)` branch — when contextFactory is absent, the filter is skipped and the full manifest is returned.

- **`SemanticProbe.evaluateProbes` uses `Promise.all` — one failure rejects entire batch (Bug #19)** — If any single probe failed (network error, timeout), `Promise.all` rejected the entire batch, discarding all other successful results. Fixed by replacing `Promise.all` with `Promise.allSettled` — fulfilled results are used normally, rejected probes produce graceful fallback results with `similarityScore: 0.5` and `driftLevel: 'medium'`.

- **`systemRulesFingerprint` hashes schema keys instead of actual rules (Bug #20)** — The `ToolBehavior` interface promised "SHA-256 of sorted rule strings" but `materializeBehavior` hashed presenter schema keys. Changing rules without changing the schema produced the same fingerprint. Fixed by adding `getStaticRuleStrings()` to Presenter, `presenterStaticRules` to ActionMetadata, and wiring through GroupedToolBuilder. The fingerprint now hashes actual rule strings.

- **Duplicate prompt names corrupt lockfile integrity digest (Bug #21)** — If two prompt builders shared the same name, the code produced duplicate entries in `promptDigestParts`, inflating the integrity digest. `.find()` always returned the first, silently ignoring the second. Fixed by replacing the array+find pattern with a `Map<string, PromptBuilder>` (last-wins deduplication) before iterating.

- **`injectLoopbackDispatcher` mutates context object unsafely (Bug #22)** — Direct `ctx['invokeTool'] = ...` mutation failed with frozen objects, read-only getters, or shared contexts across requests. Fixed by changing the function to return a new `TContext` via `Object.create(ctx)` (prototype-based proxy) for objects, or `Object.assign({})` for null/undefined. Caller updated to use the enriched context.

### Test Suite

- **15 new regression tests** in `MediumBugs-17-18-19-20-21-22.test.ts` — CursorCodec concurrency (3 tests), IntrospectionResource filter safety (1 test), SemanticProbe batch resilience (3 tests), ToolContract fingerprint accuracy (3 tests), CapabilityLockfile dedup (2 tests), ServerAttachment ctx isolation (3 tests).
- **Updated** 2 existing IntrospectionIntegration tests to align with the new filter-skip behavior (Bug #18).
- **Updated** ManifestCompiler test helper to include new `presenterStaticRules` field.

## [3.1.8] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Tools registered after `enableDebug()`/`enableTracing()` are not instrumented (Bug #12)** — `enableDebug()`, `enableTracing()`, and `enableTelemetry()` only iterated currently registered builders. New builders added via `register()` were never instrumented. Fixed by adding `_propagateObservability()` called from `register()`, and storing the telemetry sink in `_telemetrySink`.

- **`FluentSchemaHelpers.default()` is text-only — doesn't mark field as optional (Bug #13)** — `.default(value)` on FluentString/FluentNumber/FluentBoolean only appended `(default: ...)` to the description text. The LLM would see "default: 10", omit the field, and Zod validation would fail. Fixed by auto-setting `_optional = true` when `.default()` is called.

- **PostProcessor regex doesn't match `<domain_rules>` format (Bug #14)** — The telemetry regex searched for `[SYSTEM_RULES]` but ResponseBuilder now emits rules inside `<domain_rules>` XML tags. Rules were never captured for telemetry. Fixed regex to `/<domain_rules>\n([\s\S]*?)\n<\/domain_rules>/`.

- **`TelemetryBus` SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers prevent process termination (Bug #15)** — Using `process.on('SIGINT')` replaced the default termination behavior. The exit handler only called `cleanup()` but never terminated the process. Fixed by using `process.once()` and re-emitting the signal via `process.kill(process.pid, signal)` after cleanup.

- **`SandboxGuard` accepts async functions that silently produce empty results (Bug #16)** — The sandbox wraps code with `JSON.stringify(__fn__(__input__))`. For async functions, `__fn__()` returns a Promise, and `JSON.stringify(promise)` produces `'{}'`. Fixed by adding `/^\s*async\b/` to `SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS` with a descriptive error explaining why async is not supported.

### Test Suite

- **22 new regression tests** in `MediumBugs-12-13-14-15-16.test.ts` — ToolRegistry late-registration propagation (5 tests), FluentSchemaHelpers default-to-optional (6 tests), PostProcessor regex (4 tests), TelemetryBus signal handling (1 test), SandboxGuard async rejection (6 tests).
- **Updated** existing SandboxGuard tests to expect async rejection (3 tests corrected).
- **Updated** DebugObserver test to expect late-registered tools to receive debug events.

## [3.1.7] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`Group.addChildGroup()` does not remove child from previous parent (Bug #7)** — When a child group was re-parented, it was added to the new parent but never removed from the old one, creating an inconsistent tree where the child appeared under two parents simultaneously. Fixed by calling `childGroup.parent.removeChildGroup(childGroup)` before adding to the new parent.

- **`timingSafeCompare` leaks timing information via early return (Bug #8)** — The function returned immediately when the two strings had different lengths, leaking timing information. Although HMACs always have the same length, the function violated its own constant-time contract. Fixed by removing the early return and using a `Math.max(len)` loop with XOR accumulation seeded with `bufA.length ^ bufB.length`.

- **`autoValidator()` silently mishandles async validators (Bug #9)** — If an async validator was passed via `autoValidator()`, `spec.validate(value)` returned a `Promise`. Since `'value' in promise` is `false`, the result silently became `{ success: false, issues: undefined }`. Fixed by adding a `typeof result.then === 'function'` guard that throws a descriptive error with the vendor name.

- **`mergeHooks` discards secondary `wrapResponse` return value (Bug #10)** — When both primary and secondary hooks defined `wrapResponse`, the secondary was called but its return value was discarded. Fixed: `return secondary.wrapResponse?.(wrapped) ?? wrapped;`.

- **`.tags()` replaces vs. accumulates inconsistently between builders (Bug #11)** — `GroupedToolBuilder.tags()` used assignment (`this._tags = tags`) replacing all tags, while `FluentToolBuilder.tags()` used push. Fixed `GroupedToolBuilder.tags()` to use `this._tags.push(...tags)` for consistent accumulation.

- **JWT test: signature corruption in padding bits (test fix)** — The `rejects token with unicode in signature` test corrupted only the last base64url character of an HMAC-SHA256 signature. For 32-byte digests the last character has 2 padding bits, so swapping between certain characters (e.g. A↔B) produces identical decoded bytes. Fixed by corrupting a middle character instead.

### Test Suite

- **6 new regression tests** in `Group.reparenting-bug7.test.ts` — Re-parenting removes from old parent, childGroups length updates, child never in two parents, getRoot() after re-parent, same-child no-op, null parent works.
- **17 new regression tests** in `MediumBugs-8-9-10-11.test.ts` — Timing-safe comparison (5 tests), async validator guard (3 tests), wrapResponse chaining (4 tests), tags accumulation for GroupedToolBuilder (4 tests) and FluentToolBuilder consistency (1 test).

## [3.1.6] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **Race condition: concurrent requests share mutable FSM state (Bug #3)** — The `StateMachineGate` instance was shared across all concurrent requests. In serverless/edge deployments, two simultaneous requests could interleave `restore()` → `transition()` → `save()`, corrupting the FSM state. Fixed by adding a `clone()` method to `StateMachineGate` that creates an independent copy with the same config and bindings but isolated mutable state. The `createToolListHandler` and `createToolCallHandler` in `ServerAttachment` now clone the FSM per-request when `fsmStore` is present.

- **Underscore parsing breaks Inspector topology (Bug #4)** — `startServer.ts` split flat tool names by `'_'` to extract group/action for the telemetry bus topology. For a tool named `user_accounts_list`, this produced `group = "user"` and `action = "accounts_list"` — incorrect. Fixed by using `builder.getName()` directly as the group and `actionKey` as the action, eliminating the naive underscore split.

- **Same underscore split bug in telemetry route events (Bug #5)** — `ServerAttachment.ts` used `name.split('_')` in the telemetry route event emission, producing incorrect group/action attribution for tools with underscores in their names. Fixed by resolving group/action from the exposition routing map (`flatRoute.builder.getName()` and `flatRoute.actionKey`).

- **`createGroup.execute()` throws exceptions instead of returning `ToolResponse` (Bug #6)** — The function threw `Error` for unknown actions and `ZodError` for validation failures, but the signature promises `Promise<ToolResponse>`. Callers without try-catch would get unhandled exceptions, potentially crashing the MCP server. Fixed by returning `toolError()` with code `INVALID_PARAMS` for unknown actions and using `safeParse()` to return validation errors as `ToolResponse` with `isError: true` and detailed issue descriptions.

- **`schema.strict()` re-allocated on every `execute()` call (Bug #23)** — `schema.strict()` returns a new `ZodObject` on each invocation. Strict schemas are now pre-computed at group creation time in a `strictSchemaMap`.

### Test Suite

- **8 new regression tests** in `StateMachineGate.concurrency-bug3.test.ts` — Simulates actual serverless race conditions with concurrent restore/transition/save on shared vs cloned gates, verifies clone isolation, binding deep-copy, visibility, snapshots, callbacks, and dispose independence.
- **10 new regression tests** in `StateMachineGate.clone-regression.test.ts` — Tests clone independence, state mutation isolation, restored state preservation, binding/event preservation, concurrent session simulation, snapshot independence, tool visibility, uninitialized clone safety, and rapid parallel clones.
- **10 new regression tests** in `UnderscoreParsing.bug4-5.test.ts` — Demonstrates naive split vs routing map for multi-underscore names, topology map correctness with `getName()`, telemetry event attribution, action-with-underscores edge case, dot separator, and fallback behavior.
- **7 new regression tests** in `UnderscoreParsing.regression.test.ts` — Routing map group resolution, multi-underscore names, simple names, naive split comparison, topology map, dot separator, and fallback.
- **12 new regression tests** in `CreateGroup.contractCompliance-bug6.test.ts` — Verifies execute() never throws for input errors, returns isError ToolResponse for unknown actions/validation failures, includes field paths and available actions, strict schema enforcement, handler runtime errors still propagate, and empty group edge case.
- **8 new regression tests** in `CreateGroup.errorHandling-regression.test.ts` — Unknown action error response, Zod validation failure response, wrong field type, strict schema unknown fields, successful execution, field path inclusion, available actions listing, and handler error propagation.

---

## [3.1.5] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- **`StateMachineGate.restore()` loses restored state in serverless/edge environments** — `restore()` set `_currentState` but never synchronized with the XState actor. When `transition()` was called next, `init()` created the actor from `config.initial` (the default state), and the actor's subscription callback overwrote `_currentState` back to the initial state, silently discarding the restored state. Fixed by making `init()` create the machine with `_currentState` when it differs from `config.initial`, and having `restore()` stop any running actor and mark as uninitialized so the next transition re-creates the machine from the restored state.

- **`DevServer.performReload` passes empty object as registry — crash on HMR reload** — The HMR reload called `await setup({} as ToolRegistryLike)`. The empty object `{}` has no `register()` method, so any setup callback calling `registry.register(builder)` threw `TypeError: registry.register is not a function`. Fixed by replacing the empty object with a proper duck-typed registry implementing `register()` and `getBuilders()`.

### Test Suite

- **10 new regression tests** in `StateMachineGate.restore-regression.test.ts` — Covers restore-before-init, restore-after-init, multiple restore cycles, tool visibility after restore, callbacks after restore, linear pipeline restore, and concurrent session simulation. Uses XState mock to reproduce the exact actor subscription bug.
- **8 new regression tests** in `DevServer.reload-regression.test.ts` — Covers register() invocation during reload, builder collection, fresh registry per reload (no leaks), various builder types, error handling after registrations, async setup, and MCP notification on success/failure.

---

## [3.1.4] - 2026-03-02

### Improved

- **Grouped tool descriptions now include dispatch instructions** — AI agents seeing a grouped tool (e.g., `users` with actions `get_me`, `get_me_top_artists`) now receive a clear instruction: `Select operation via the \`action\` parameter.` This fixes discoverability issues where AI clients could see the action names listed but didn't know they needed to pass `{ "action": "get_me_top_artists" }` to invoke a specific operation. Applies to both standard and TOON description generators.

---

## [3.1.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Enum vs non-enum field conflict blocks OpenAPI imports** — `assertFieldCompatibility()` threw when one action declared an enum for a field and another declared the same field as a plain string. In OpenAPI specs, this naturally occurs when the same parameter has constrained values in one endpoint and unconstrained in another. The non-enum declaration (superset) now wins — the enum constraint is dropped, widening the field to accept any value of the base type.

### Test Suite

- **3 updated tests** — enum-vs-string conflict tests now validate widening behavior

---

## [3.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Enum field conflict in grouped tools blocks OpenAPI imports** — `assertFieldCompatibility()` in `SchemaUtils` threw when two actions in the same `GroupedToolBuilder` shared a field name (e.g., `type`) with different enum value sets. Large OpenAPI specs like Spotify naturally have endpoints that share parameter names with different valid enum values (e.g., `type: ["artist","user"]` vs `type: ["track","album"]`). Enum values are now **merged (union)** instead of throwing a conflict error. Base type mismatches and enum-vs-non-enum conflicts still throw as before.

### Changed

- **`assertFieldCompatibility()` return type** — now returns `object | undefined` instead of `void`. Returns the merged JSON Schema property when enum values are merged, or `undefined` when no merge is needed.
- **`collectActionFields()` in `SchemaGenerator`** — applies the merged property returned by `assertFieldCompatibility()` to update the input schema with the union of all enum values.

### Test Suite

- **8 new tests** in `SchemaCollision.test.ts` (section 10: Enum Merge):
  - Two different enum sets merged into union
  - Deduplicate overlapping enum values
  - 3-way cumulative merge across 3+ actions
  - Identical enums preserved (no unnecessary merge)
  - Base type preserved in merged property
  - Enum vs non-enum still throws
  - Base type conflicts still throw
  - Runtime executes correctly after enum merge
- **2 updated tests** — existing enum conflict tests now validate merge behavior instead of throw

---

## [3.1.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Flat exposition `_default` suffix on single-action builders** — `compileFlat()` in `ExpositionCompiler` was unconditionally appending `_{actionKey}` to every flat tool name, producing names like `get_pet_findByStatus_default` for standalone `f.query()` / `f.mutation()` / `f.action()` tools. Single-action builders with the `'default'` action key now use the bare tool name (e.g., `get_pet_findByStatus`). Multi-action builders and named single actions retain the `toolName_actionKey` format.

### Test Suite

- **3 new tests** in `ToolExposition.test.ts`:
  - Single-action builder uses bare tool name (no `_default` suffix)
  - Multi-action builder still produces `toolName_actionKey`
  - Routing dispatch map resolves single-action tools by bare name

---

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-28

### 📦 Ecosystem — README Standardization & Inspector Publication

### Added

- **`@vurb/inspector` v1.0.0 → v1.0.1** — Published to npm. Real-time terminal dashboard for Vurb.ts servers via Shadow Socket (IPC).

### Fixed

- **Scaffold test assertions** — Updated `create.e2e.test.ts` and `create.test.ts` to match current `startServer()` template (was `new Server()` / `StdioServerTransport`). File count 17 → 18. Removed outdated `prompts.size` check.
- **Inspector docs badge layout** — Badges now render inline instead of stacking vertically over the title.

### Changed

- **README standardization** — All 12 package READMEs follow the same layout: centered header (`<p align="center">`), HTML badges (npm, license, node), blockquote tagline, features table, code examples, peer dependencies, requirements.
- **Core README** — `packages/core/README.md` mirrors the root monorepo README for npmjs.com display.

### Ecosystem v1.0.1

All sub-packages bumped to 1.0.1 for README updates:
`Vurb.ts-api-key`, `Vurb.ts-aws`, `Vurb.ts-cloudflare`, `mcp-Vurb.ts-inspector`, `Vurb.ts-jwt`, `Vurb.ts-n8n`, `Vurb.ts-oauth`, `Vurb.ts-openapi-gen`, `Vurb.ts-prisma-gen`, `Vurb.ts-testing`, `Vurb.ts-vercel`.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-28

### 🧠 FSM State Gate — Temporal Anti-Hallucination Engine

The first framework where it is **physically impossible** for an AI to execute tools out of order. Powered by XState v5, the FSM State Gate dynamically controls tool visibility at the `tools/list` protocol level based on finite state machine state — the LLM literally cannot call a tool that doesn't exist in its tool list.

Three complementary anti-hallucination layers:
- **Layer 1 — Format**: Zod validates input shape
- **Layer 2 — Guidance**: `suggestActions` (HATEOAS) recommends next tool — LLM can ignore
- **Layer 3 — Gate**: FSM State Gate physically removes tools — LLM **cannot** call them

### Added

- **`StateMachineGate` module** (`src/fsm/StateMachineGate.ts`) — core FSM engine:
  - `StateMachineGate(config)` — creates FSM from XState v5-compatible config
  - `bindTool(name, states, event?)` — bind tool to FSM states with optional auto-transition
  - `isToolAllowed(name)` — check tool visibility in current state
  - `getVisibleToolNames(allTools)` — filter tool list by current FSM state
  - `transition(event)` — advance FSM state, returns `TransitionResult`
  - `onTransition(callback)` — register callback for `notifications/tools/list_changed`

## [2.14.0] - 2026-02-28

### 🛡️ DLP Compliance Engine — Zero-Leak PII Redaction (GDPR / LGPD / HIPAA)

Vurb.ts now structurally masks Personally Identifiable Information before it reaches the LLM. Powered by `fast-redact` — the same V8-compiled engine behind Pino — the framework guarantees zero-leak at the wire level. Once `.redactPII()` is configured, it is **physically impossible** for a developer to accidentally expose sensitive data through the MCP JSON-RPC payload.

### Added

- **`RedactEngine` module** (`src/presenter/RedactEngine.ts`) — core DLP engine:
  - `compileRedactor(config)` — compiles `fast-redact` paths into a V8-optimized function at configuration time
  - `initRedactEngine()` — optional boot-time pre-loading for first-call latency elimination
  - Lazy dynamic `import('fast-redact')` with graceful fallback when not installed
  - Follows the existing `JsonSerializer` pattern for optional peer dependencies
- **`Presenter.redactPII(paths, censor?)`** — fluent method to configure PII redaction paths
  - `.redact()` alias for ergonomic use
  - Supports string censors (`'[REDACTED]'`, `'***'`) and function censors (`(v) => '****-' + String(v).slice(-4)`)
  - Default censor: `'[REDACTED]'`
- **Late Guillotine Pattern** — redaction applied via `structuredClone()` **after** UI blocks and system rules see full data
  - UI formatting logic can reference sensitive fields without exposing them
  - Only the final wire payload is sanitized
- **`definePresenter()` integration** — `redactPII: { paths, censor }` config field for declarative API
- **`fast-redact` as optional peer dependency** — install only on servers that handle PII
- **`fast-redact.d.ts`** — ambient type declaration for dynamic import
- **Path syntax** — dot notation, bracket notation, wildcards (`*.ssn`), array items (`patients[*].diagnosis`)

### Documentation

- **`docs/dlp-redaction.md`** — full documentation page (~350 lines): architecture diagrams, Late Guillotine pattern, installation, Quick Start (fluent + declarative), custom censors, path syntax reference, boot-time initialization, standalone usage, GDPR/LGPD/HIPAA compliance matrices, integration with Sandbox Engine and AOT Serialization, best practices, API reference
- **VitePress sidebar** — "DLP Redaction — GDPR" under Core Framework section
- **SEO** — title, meta description, and 7 FAQ entries for Google rich snippets
- **Keywords** — `dlp`, `compliance`, `pii-redaction` added to `package.json`

### Test Suite

- **26 new tests** in `RedactEngine.test.ts`:
  - RedactEngine unit (10 tests): flat field, custom string/function censor, wildcards, array wildcards, empty paths, missing target, primitives, immutability, initRedactEngine
  - Presenter integration (11 tests): flat/nested redaction, custom censors, array items, Late Guillotine (UI blocks + system rules), .redact() alias, chaining, untyped schema, sealed check, missing field
  - Declarative API (2 tests): definePresenter with redactPII config, custom censor
  - E2E (1 test): full pipeline with schema + rules + ui + redact + agentLimit

## [2.13.1] - 2026-02-28

### 🛡️ Connection Watchdog — AbortSignal Kill-Switch for V8 Isolates

When a user closes their MCP client mid-request, the TCP connection dies but Node.js doesn't know. The sandbox keeps running an expensive computation that nobody will ever read, leaking CPU and native memory. The Connection Watchdog solves this with an instant kill-switch.

### Added

- **`AbortSignal` support in `SandboxEngine.execute()`** — new optional `{ signal: AbortSignal }` parameter
  - **Pre-flight check** — already-aborted signals skip all V8 allocation and return `ABORTED` immediately (zero overhead)
  - **Mid-execution kill** — abort listener calls `isolate.dispose()` during V8 execution, killing C++ threads instantly
  - **Error classification** — aborts are correctly classified as `ABORTED` (not `MEMORY`), distinguishing intentional kills from OOM
  - **Listener cleanup** — abort listener removed in `finally` block to prevent memory leaks
  - **Auto-recovery** — `_ensureIsolate()` detects disposed isolates and creates a fresh one on the next `execute()` call
- **`ABORTED` error code** — new `SandboxErrorCode` value for client disconnection scenarios
- **Backward compatibility** — `execute()` without signal works exactly as before

### Fixed

- **Dead parameter removed** — `_classifyError` received `executionMs` but never used it (code smell)
- **ASCII diagram updated** — module JSDoc now reflects the abort step, new `execute()` signature, and `signal.removeEventListener()` in finally block
- **`console.log` test fix** — V8 >= 12.x defines `console` as a built-in; test updated to assert `undefined` return instead of `ReferenceError`

### Documentation

- **`docs/sandbox.md`** — full Connection Watchdog section with diagrams, usage, error classification, and guarantees table. Architecture diagram updated with abort step. API reference updated with new `execute()` signature. `ABORTED` error code added to error table.
- **`seo.ts`** — 2 new FAQs: "What is the Connection Watchdog?" and "How does AbortSignal integration work?"
- **`llms.txt`** — new Zero-Trust Sandbox Engine section with full API, error codes, and Connection Watchdog description

### Test Suite

- **`SandboxAbortSignal.test.ts`** — 24 new tests covering:
  - Pre-flight abort (4 tests): immediate return, no V8 allocation, recovery after abort, abort wins over guard
  - Mid-execution kill-switch (3 tests): infinite loop kill, abort beats timeout, event loop not blocked
  - Auto-recovery (3 tests): single recovery, signal on recovered engine, multiple abort-recovery cycles
  - Listener cleanup (3 tests): cleanup after success, cleanup after error, no leaks across 50 calls
  - Backward compatibility (4 tests): no signal, undefined options, empty options, undefined signal
  - Edge cases (5 tests): late abort no-op, disposed engine + signal, invalid code + abort, null data, double abort
  - Pointer lifecycle (2 tests): native memory after abort, memory across multiple abort cycles
- **138 tests** passing (1 skipped), 6 test files — zero regressions

## [2.13.0] - 2026-02-28

### 🔒 Zero-Trust Sandbox Engine — V8 Isolate for Computation Delegation

LLMs can now send JavaScript functions to be executed in a sealed V8 isolate on the server. The data stays on the client's machine — only the computed result crosses the boundary. Powered by `isolated-vm`.

### Added

- **`SandboxEngine`** — V8 isolate engine with configurable timeout, memory limit, and output size cap
  - `execute<T>(code, data)` — runs LLM-generated JavaScript in a pristine, empty V8 Context
  - `dispose()` — releases native C++ memory (mandatory)
  - Automatic isolate recovery after OOM kills
  - One Isolate per engine (reused), new Context per call (pristine)
- **`SandboxConfig`** — `{ timeout: 5000, memoryLimit: 128, maxOutputBytes: 1_048_576 }`
- **`SandboxResult<T>`** — discriminated union: `{ ok: true, value, executionMs }` | `{ ok: false, error, code }`
- **`SandboxErrorCode`** — `TIMEOUT | MEMORY | SYNTAX | RUNTIME | OUTPUT_TOO_LARGE | INVALID_CODE | UNAVAILABLE`
- **`validateSandboxCode()`** — fail-fast syntax checker (not a security boundary)
- **`FluentToolBuilder.sandboxed(config?)`** — enables sandbox + HATEOAS auto-prompting on any tool
- **`f.sandbox(config?)`** — factory method on `initVurb()` instance
- **`SANDBOX_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`** — auto-injected tool description for LLM guidance
- **V8 Security Model** — empty Context: no process, require, fs, net, setTimeout, Buffer, fetch, eval

### Documentation

- **`docs/sandbox.md`** — full documentation: architecture, installation, quick start (Fluent API + Standalone + Factory), configuration, result type, error codes, V8 engineering rules, security model, attack vector table, SandboxGuard, HATEOAS auto-prompting, best practices, API reference

## [2.8.1] - 2026-02-26

### 🛡️ Hardened Blast Radius — Code Evaluation Detection & Anti-Evasion Heuristics

Multi-layer defense upgrade for the EntitlementScanner. The regex-based pattern library was intentionally conservative but blind to `eval()`, dynamic `require()`, and obfuscated code. Any actor aware of the regex patterns could bypass detection. This release closes that gap with three complementary detection layers.

### Added

- **Code Evaluation Category** — new `codeEvaluation` entitlement category with 14 detection patterns:
  - `eval()`, indirect eval `(0, eval)()`, `globalThis.eval()`
  - `new Function()`, `Reflect.construct(Function, ...)`
  - `vm` module: `runInNewContext`, `runInThisContext`, `compileFunction`, `new vm.Script`
  - `process.binding()`, `process.dlopen()`
  - Code evaluation always produces `error` severity — blast radius is unbounded
  - `readOnly: true` + `codeEvaluation` is always an error, even with `allowed: ['codeEvaluation']`

- **Evasion Heuristic Detection** — `scanEvasionIndicators()` detects techniques used to bypass static analysis:
  - **String construction**: `String.fromCharCode()`, `String.raw`, `atob()`, `Buffer.from(…, 'base64')`
  - **Indirect access**: `globalThis['eval']`, `globalThis['ev'+'al']`, `process['binding']`
  - **Computed imports**: `require(variable)`, `import(variable)` — non-literal module names
  - **Encoding density**: high ratio of `\x??`/`\u????` escapes in source
  - **Entropy anomaly**: Shannon entropy > 5.0 in string literals (statistically unlikely in normal code)
  - Three confidence levels: `high` (makes handler UNSAFE), `medium`, `low`

- **`EvasionIndicator` type** — structured evasion report with `type`, `confidence`, `description`, `context`, `line`
- **`EvasionType`** — `'string-construction' | 'indirect-access' | 'computed-import' | 'encoding-density' | 'entropy-anomaly'`
- **`EntitlementReport.evasionIndicators`** — evasion indicators included in full scan reports
- **`HandlerEntitlements.codeEvaluation`** — new boolean flag across `ToolContract`, `BehaviorDigest`, `ContractDiff`, `CapabilityLockfile`
- **`LockfileEntitlements.codeEvaluation`** — lockfile captures code evaluation entitlement
- **`ContractDiff`** — gaining `codeEvaluation` is a `BREAKING` severity change

### Changed

- `EntitlementReport.safe` now considers both error-severity violations AND high-confidence evasion indicators
- `EntitlementReport.summary` includes evasion indicator count when present
- `EntitlementCategory` union expanded: `'filesystem' | 'network' | 'subprocess' | 'crypto' | 'codeEvaluation'`

### Documentation

- [Blast Radius docs](docs/governance/blast-radius.md) rewritten with defense-in-depth architecture, evasion heuristics section, `EvasionIndicator` API reference, adversarial examples
- [Governance index](docs/governance/index.md) updated: lockfile example includes `codeEvaluation`, blast radius description updated

### Test Suite

- **43 new hardened tests** covering code evaluation detection, evasion heuristics, adversarial evasion scenarios, and contract diff integration
- **2630 total tests**, 0 failures, 109 test files

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-26

### 🛡️ Governance Stack — Deterministic Contract Auditing, Behavioral Fingerprinting & CI Lockfile Gating

8-module governance layer for compile-time and runtime introspection of MCP server behavioral surfaces. Addresses gaps in contract auditability, drift detection, blast-radius analysis, and token cost profiling — originally identified by [@jordanstarrk](https://github.com/jordanstarrk).

### Added

- **Tool Contract Materialization**
  - `materializeContract(builder)` → `ToolContract` — extracts the full behavioral surface: schema, entitlements, cognitive guardrails, token economics, and SHA-256 integrity digest

  - `ToolContract`, `ToolSurface`, `ActionContract`, `ToolBehavior`, `CognitiveGuardrailsContract`, `TokenEconomicsProfile`, `HandlerEntitlements` types

- **Contract Diffing**
  - `diffContracts(before, after)` → `ContractDiffResult` — semantic structural diff with severity classification (`BREAKING`, `RISKY`, `SAFE`, `COSMETIC`)
  - `formatDiffReport(result)` → human-readable diff report
  - `formatDeltasAsXml(deltas)` → injection-safe XML for agent consumption
  - 7 delta categories: `schema`, `behavior`, `security`, `guardrails`, `performance`, `entitlements`, `tool-lifecycle`

- **Behavioral Fingerprinting (SHA-256)**
  - `computeDigest(contract)` → `BehaviorDigestResult` — deterministic behavioral fingerprint via canonicalized JSON + SHA-256
  - `computeServerDigest(contracts)` → `ServerDigest` — aggregate server-wide digest
  - `compareServerDigests(a, b)` → `DigestComparison` — drift detection with added/removed/changed tool lists

- **Capability Lockfile (`vurb.lock`)**
  - `generateLockfile(options)` — captures tools, prompts, digests, entitlements, token economics in a git-diffable JSON lockfile
  - `checkLockfile(current, stored)` → `LockfileCheckResult` — structural comparison with detailed diff messages
  - `writeLockfile()` / `readLockfile()` / `parseLockfile()` / `serializeLockfile()` — full I/O lifecycle
  - Prompt lockfile support: argument schemas, tags, hydration timeout

- **Zero-Trust Cryptographic Attestation**
  - `createHmacSigner(secret)` → HMAC-SHA-256 signer
  - `attestServerDigest(digest, signer)` → `AttestationResult` — signed digest with timestamp + nonce

- **Entitlement Scanner (Blast Radius)**
  - `scanSource(source)` — static analysis detecting filesystem, network, subprocess, and crypto API usage in handler source
  - `buildEntitlements(matches)` → `HandlerEntitlements` — aggregate into entitlement categories
  - `validateClaims(report, claims)` → `EntitlementViolation[]` — verify declared vs. actual capabilities
  - `scanAndValidate()` — combined scan + validation

- **Semantic Probing (LLM-as-Judge)**
  - `createProbe(config)` → `SemanticProbe` — contract-based semantic drift probes
  - `buildJudgePrompt()` / `parseJudgeResponse()` — LLM judge prompt generation and response parsing
  - `evaluateProbe()` / `evaluateProbes()` → batch evaluation with aggregate scoring
  - `DriftLevel` — `'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'`

- **Contract-Aware Self-Healing**
  - `enrichValidationError(error, contract)` — enriches validation errors with contract context for improved agent self-correction
  - `createToolEnhancer(contracts)` — pipeline-level error enhancer factory

- **Governance Observer (Observability Bridge)**
  - `createGovernanceObserver(config)` — wraps governance operations with `DebugEvent` emission (`type: 'governance'`) and optional OTel tracing spans
  - `createNoopObserver()` — zero-overhead passthrough for production
  - `GovernanceEvent` added to the `DebugEvent` discriminated union — `{ type: 'governance', operation, label, outcome, detail?, durationMs, timestamp }`
  - `GovernanceOperation` — 11 operation identifiers: `contract.compile`, `contract.diff`, `digest.compute`, `lockfile.generate`, `lockfile.check`, `lockfile.write`, `lockfile.read`, `attestation.sign`, `attestation.verify`, `entitlement.scan`, `token.profile`

  - `Vurb.ts lock [--server <entrypoint>] [--name <serverName>]` — generate or update `vurb.lock`
  - `Vurb.ts lock --check [--server <entrypoint>]` — verify lockfile matches current server (CI gate, exits 0 or 1)
  - Composer/Yarn-style progress output with step timing and status icons
  - `bin.fusion` added to `package.json` — `npx Vurb.ts lock` works out of the box

### Fixed

- **[SECURITY] XML injection via `formatDeltasAsXml()`** — delta `description`, `path`, `before`, and `after` fields are now XML-escaped before interpolation into `<delta>` elements, preventing injection of arbitrary XML via crafted contract values

### Documentation

- **7 governance documentation pages** — `docs/governance/` section with index, contract-diffing, blast-radius, lockfile, observability integration, and cross-references
- **Observability docs updated** — `GovernanceEvent`, `GovernanceOperation`, `GovernanceObserver` API reference added to `docs/observability.md` and `docs/api-reference.md`
- **Documentation tone review** — all marketing/superlative language removed across 12+ files; replaced with technical, factual phrasing throughout

### Test Suite

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### 🚀 DX Overhaul — Zero-Friction APIs, Functional Core, Standard Schema

Complete developer experience overhaul: 8 new APIs designed to eliminate boilerplate, enable instant autocomplete, and make the framework feel as effortless as tRPC or Hono.

### Added

- **`initVurb<TContext>()`** — tRPC-style context initialization. Define the context type once, every `f.tool()`, `f.presenter()`, `f.prompt()`, `f.middleware()`, `f.registry()` inherits it automatically. Zero generic repetition.
  - `f.tool({ name, input, handler })` — handler receives `{ input, ctx }` destructured (tRPC v11 pattern). `'domain.action'` naming auto-splits into tool name + action.
  - `f.presenter(config)` — delegates to `definePresenter()` with context typing
  - `f.prompt(name, config)` — context-typed prompt factory
  - `f.middleware(deriveFn)` — context derivation factory
  - `f.defineTool(name, config)` — full `ToolConfig` power with context typing
  - `f.registry()` — pre-typed `ToolRegistry` factory
  - Auto-wraps non-`ToolResponse` handler returns via `success()`

- **`definePresenter(config)`** — Declarative object-config API replacing fluent builder chains. Schema-driven type inference — zero generic noise, instant Ctrl+Space autocomplete.
  - `PresenterConfig<T>` — `{ name, schema, rules, ui, collectionUi, agentLimit, suggestActions, embeds, autoRules }`
  - `autoRules` (default: `true`) — auto-extracts Zod `.describe()` annotations and merges them with explicit rules
  - `extractZodDescriptions(schema)` — walks Zod AST, unwraps optional/nullable/default/branded wrappers, returns `"field: description"` strings
  - Produces standard `Presenter<T>` — interchangeable with `createPresenter()` anywhere

- **`autoDiscover(registry, dir, options?)`** — File-based routing. Scans a directory tree and auto-registers tool builders.
  - Resolution: `default` export → named `tool` export → any exported ToolBuilder
  - Options: `pattern` (regex filter), `recursive` (default: `true`), `loader` (`'esm'` | `'cjs'`), custom `resolve` function
  - Excludes `.test.`, `.spec.`, and `.d.ts` files automatically

- **`createDevServer(config)`** — HMR development server. File changes reload tools without restarting the LLM client.
  - `DevServerConfig` — `{ dir, extensions, debounce, setup, onReload, server }`
  - Sends `notifications/tools/list_changed` to MCP client on reload
  - ESM cache-busting via URL timestamp query parameter
  - CJS cache invalidation via `require.cache` cleanup
  - 300ms default debounce to prevent rapid-fire reloads

- **`createGroup(config)`** — Functional closure-based tool groups. Pre-composed middleware at creation time (O(1) dispatch), `Object.freeze()` by default.
  - `GroupConfig<TContext>` — `{ name, description, tags, middleware, actions }`
  - `CompiledGroup<TContext>` — `.execute(ctx, action, args)`, `.getAction(name)`, `.actionNames`
  - Middleware: right-to-left composition via `reduceRight`, per-action + global merge
  - Zod `.strict().parse()` validation per action

- **Standard Schema v1 Abstraction Layer** — Decouple from Zod, support any validator implementing the Standard Schema spec.
  - `StandardSchemaV1<TInput, TOutput>` interface
  - `VurbValidator<T>` — `.validate(value)`, `.vendor`, `.schema`
  - `toStandardValidator(schema)` — wrap Standard Schema v1 (Valibot, ArkType, etc.)
  - `fromZodSchema(schema)` — wrap Zod via `.safeParse()`
  - `autoValidator(schema)` — auto-detect schema type (Standard Schema → Zod → error)
  - `isStandardSchema(value)` — duck-type guard
  - `ValidationResult<T>`, `InferStandardOutput<T>`, `StandardSchemaIssue` types

- **Subpath Exports** — 10 tree-shakeable entry points:
  - `Vurb.ts` (full), `/client`, `/ui`, `/presenter`, `/prompt`, `/state-sync`, `/observability`, `/dev`, `/schema`, `/testing`

### Documentation

- **Presenter elevated to hero position** — README Quick Start now shows: `initVurb()` → `definePresenter()` → `f.tool({ returns: Presenter })` → `f.prompt({ fromView })` → Server bootstrap. The Presenter is THE first feature section with both APIs (`definePresenter()` + `createPresenter()`) and a full capabilities table (Egress Firewall, JIT Rules, Server-Rendered UI, Cognitive Guardrails, Action Affordances, Relational Composition, Prompt Bridge).
- **No-Zod JSON Descriptors shown everywhere** — All Quick Start examples, tool examples, and prompt examples use JSON param descriptors (`'string'`, `{ type: 'number', min: 0 }`, `{ enum: [...] as const }`) as the recommended API. Zod shown as the alternative tab.
- **Prompt Engine given equal DX treatment** — `f.prompt()` shown alongside `f.tool()` in every Quick Start. `PromptMessage.fromView()` bridge to Presenter shown prominently.
- **Comprehensive documentation rewrite** — 20+ doc files updated with `f.tool()` / `f.prompt()` tabs, No-Zod examples, Presenter integration. New `docs/dx-guide.md` covers all 8 new features.
- **README.md full rewrite** — New Quick Start (5 steps: init → Presenter → tools → prompts → server), Presenter hero section, expanded capabilities table, JSON Param Descriptor reference, Zod marked as optional.
- **llms.txt rewrite** — Presenter-first Quick Start, expanded Presenter API section with definePresenter + createPresenter + layers table, Prompt Engine with No-Zod examples and fromView bridge.
- New `docs/dx-guide.md` — comprehensive DX guide covering all 8 new features with migration table
- Updated `llms.txt` — new public API entries (Context Initialization, Declarative Presenter, Functional Groups, File-Based Routing, Dev Server, Standard Schema, Subpath Exports)

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### 🛡️ Self-Healing HATEOAS · State Sync Observability · Client Middleware

Three-pillar enhancement across the framework: richer self-healing error envelopes, State Sync observability hooks, and a full-featured tRPC-style client.

### Added

- **Self-Healing Errors (Pillar A):**
  - `ErrorCode` union type — 15 canonical codes (`NOT_FOUND`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `CONFLICT`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, etc.) plus any custom string via `string & {}`
  - `ErrorSeverity` type — `'warning' | 'error' | 'critical'` with semantic `isError` mapping (warnings are non-fatal)
  - `severity` attribute on `<tool_error>` XML envelope — agents can triage errors by impact level
  - `details` option — key-value metadata rendered as `<detail key="...">value</detail>` elements (safe for any key string)
  - `retryAfter` option — `<retry_after>N seconds</retry_after>` for transient errors
  - `error(message, code?)` — optional `code` parameter for structured minimal errors
  - Individual `<action>` child elements in `<available_actions>` (replaces comma-separated format)
  - Structured error boundary in `ExecutionPipeline.runChain()` — catch block now produces `toolError('INTERNAL_ERROR', ...)` with severity and recovery hint

- **State Sync Observability (Pillar B):**
  - `onInvalidation` callback — fires after successful causal invalidation with `{ causedBy, patterns, timestamp }`
  - `notificationSink` — emits MCP `notifications/resources/updated` per invalidated pattern (fire-and-forget, async-safe)
  - `detectOverlaps(policies)` — static analysis utility returning `OverlapWarning[]` for first-match-wins ordering bugs
  - `InvalidationEvent`, `ResourceNotification`, `OverlapWarning` types exported from barrel

- **VurbClient (Pillar C):**
  - `ClientMiddleware` type — `(action, args, next) → Promise<ToolResponse>` request interceptor
  - `VurbClientOptions` interface — `{ middleware?, throwOnError? }`
  - `VurbClientError` class — parses `<tool_error>` XML into typed fields (code, message, recovery, availableActions, severity, raw)
  - `executeBatch(calls, options?)` — parallel (default) or sequential batch execution
  - `throwOnError` option — error responses auto-throw as `VurbClientError` instead of returning
  - Middleware chain compiled once at client creation (O(1) per call)
  - XML entity unescaping in parsed error fields (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`)

### Fixed

- **[CRITICAL] XML injection via detail keys** — details keys were used as XML element names (`<key>value</key>`), allowing invalid XML for keys like `"123"` or `"a b"`. Now rendered as attributes: `<detail key="...">value</detail>`
- **Severity attribute not XML-escaped** — `severity` value in `<tool_error>` was unescaped; now uses `escapeXmlAttr()`
- **Async notificationSink unhandled rejection** — `try { void sink(n); } catch {}` didn't catch async rejections; now uses `Promise.resolve(...).catch()`
- **ResponseDecorator XML injection** — `cause` and `domains` attributes in `<cache_invalidation>` were not XML-escaped; now uses `escapeXmlAttr()`
- **parseToolErrorXml missing XML entity unescaping** — parsed error messages containing `&amp;`, `&lt;`, etc. were returned with raw entities; added `unescapeXml()` decoder
- **Misleading JSDoc** — StateSyncLayer cache key comment incorrectly referenced "JSON input schema hash"; corrected to reflect tool-name-only caching

### Documentation

- Updated `docs/error-handling.md` with ErrorCode table, severity levels, structured details, retryAfter, full HATEOAS envelope example
- Updated `docs/fusion-client.md` with client middleware, `throwOnError`, `VurbClientError`, `executeBatch()`, batch options
- Updated `docs/state-sync.md` with `onInvalidation`, `notificationSink`, `detectOverlaps()`, observability hooks section
- Updated `README.md` — Self-Healing Errors, Type-Safe Client, and State Sync feature sections + capabilities table
- Updated `llms.txt` — Public API section, Self-Healing Errors section, State Sync section, Response Helpers

### Test Suite

- **52 new tests** across 3 files:
  - `SelfHealing.test.ts` (15 tests) — severity, details, retryAfter, ErrorCode, XML-unsafe keys, empty details, error() with code
  - `StateSyncEnhanced.test.ts` (16 tests) — onInvalidation, notificationSink, async rejection safety, ResponseDecorator escaping, detectOverlaps
  - `VurbClientEnhanced.test.ts` (21 tests) — middleware pipeline, throwOnError, XML entity unescaping, executeBatch, empty batch, middleware exceptions, backward compat
- All **2092 tests** passing across 94 files

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-24

### 🧪 Testing — Deterministic AI Governance Auditing

    - `PrismaFusionContext` type injection (shift-left security)
    - Tenant isolation in every query `WHERE` clause via `@vurb.tenantKey`
    - OOM pagination guard (`take` max 50, min 1, default 20)
    - MCP annotations (`readOnly`, `destructive`)
  - `NamingHelpers` — `toSnakeCase`, `toPascalCase`, `pluralize`
  - `generator.ts` — Prisma `generatorHandler()` entry point with barrel index generation
  - Shared `types.ts` for `GeneratedFile` interface (single source of truth)

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🔌 n8n Connector — Turn Workflows into MCP Tools

New `Vurb.ts-n8n` package. Auto-discovers n8n webhook workflows and produces Vurb.ts tool builders — so AI agents can call your automations natively.

### Added

- **`packages/n8n/`:** New `Vurb.ts-n8n` connector package:
  - `createN8nConnector()` — Auto-discovery mode: connects to n8n, finds webhook workflows, produces `SynthesizedTool[]`
  - `defineN8nTool()` — Manual/enterprise mode: surgically define a specific workflow as an MCP tool
  - `N8nClient` — HTTP client for n8n REST API with auth and timeout
  - `WorkflowDiscovery` — Filters webhook-triggered workflows, tag include/exclude
  - `SchemaInferrer` — Query params → strict Zod, body → `z.record(z.any())`, notes → `.describe()`
  - `ToolSynthesizer` — Workflow metadata → `defineTool()`-compatible configs

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🧬 OpenAPI Generator — Spec to MCP Server in One Command

New `Vurb.ts-openapi-gen` package that generates a complete **Vurb.ts** server from any OpenAPI 3.x specification. One command produces Zod schemas, Presenters, tool definitions, ToolRegistry, and server bootstrap — all following the MVA Convention.

### Added

- **`packages/openapi/`:** New `Vurb.ts-openapi-gen` package with full pipeline:
  - `OpenApiParser` — resolves `$ref`, extracts groups/actions/params/responses
  - `EndpointMapper` — `operationId` → `snake_case`, dedup, HTTP method → MCP annotations
  - `ZodCompiler` — `SchemaNode` → Zod code with coercion, formats, constraints
  - `CodeEmitter` — generates MVA structure (`models/`, `views/`, `agents/`, Registry, Server)
  - `ConfigLoader` — YAML config auto-detection with CLI flag overrides
  - `GeneratorConfig` — full config system with `mergeConfig()` and `DEFAULT_CONFIG`
- **`toolExposition` config** (`'flat'` | `'grouped'`): Controls how generated tools are exposed to the LLM via `attachToServer()`.
- **`actionSeparator` config** (string, default `'_'`): Controls flat mode delimiter in generated server bootstrap.
- **MVA Convention — `agents/` directory:** Renamed `tools/` → `agents/` to align directory names with MVA architectural layers (Model, View, Agent). Updated across all source, tests, and documentation.

- **1,768 tests** across 82 files, all passing.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🏗️ Monorepo Refactor — Multi-Package Architecture

**Vurb.ts** is now a monorepo with npm workspaces. The core framework lives in `packages/core/` and a new `packages/testing/` workspace provides testing utilities. This aligns with industry standards (tRPC, Vitest, Prisma) for package management and distribution.

### BREAKING

- **Project structure:** `src/` → `packages/core/src/`, `tests/` → `packages/core/tests/`. The npm package name and public API remain **unchanged** — `Vurb.ts` still exports the same modules.
- **Root `package.json`:** Now `private: true` with `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`. The root is no longer the publishable package.
- **`tsconfig.json` → `tsconfig.base.json`:** Shared TypeScript configuration is now at the root level. Each package extends it via `"extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json"`.

### Added

- **`packages/core/`:** Contains the full framework source (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), and its own `package.json` with `Vurb.ts` as the publishable name.
- **`packages/testing/`:** New `@vurb/testing` package (skeleton). Will contain mock servers, test clients, and assertion helpers.
- **Per-package CI:** `ci.yml` updated to `npm run build -ws` and `npm test -w packages/core`.
- **Per-package publish:** `publish-npm.yml` now publishes each workspace package independently.

### Fixed

- **`CursorCodec` Web Crypto API resolution:** Replaced `Function('m', 'return import(m)')` hack with variable-based indirection (`const mod = 'node:' + 'crypto'`) that works correctly in Vitest's module transformer while still avoiding TypeScript's static module resolution (no `@types/node` dependency).

### Documentation

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`:** Project Structure updated to reflect the monorepo layout.
- **`docs/testing.md`:** Updated FullStack.test.ts link to new path.
- **`docs/performance.md`:** Updated 18 internal source references.
- **`docs/cost-and-hallucination.md`:** Updated 14 internal source references.

### Test Suite

- **1,573 tests** across 70 files, all passing.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-23

### 📄 Stateless Cursor Pagination for Prompts

**Vurb.ts** now provides O(1) memory, cryptographic cursor-based pagination for `prompts/list`. Instead of loading thousands of prompts into memory or sending large payloads to MCP clients, the framework emits pages using an RFC-compliant cursor algorithm powered by the native Web Crypto API.

### Added

- **`PromptRegistry.configurePagination({ pageSize })`:** Enables stateless pagination. By default, pagination is disabled (all prompts returned).
- **`CursorCodec` module:** Implements a robust encoded cursor utilizing native `globalThis.crypto.subtle`. Zero external crypto dependencies.
- **Server integration:** Automatically extracts the `cursor` param from the `prompts/list` MCP request, decodes it, applies filters, and generates the `nextCursor` transparently.
- **Tamper resistance:** Adulterated cursors fallback gracefully to the first page without crashing the server.
- **Progress Notifications Integration:** Full E2E testing of `ProgressSink` mapping to `notifications/progress`. Generator handlers firing `yield progress()` map seamlessly without overhead.
- **Cooperative Cancellation Integration:** Full E2E testing of `AbortSignal` interception causing runaway generators and chains to abort instantly.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-23

### Hydration Timeout Sandbox — Graceful Degradation for Prompt Hydration

**Vurb.ts** now protects prompt handlers from slow/failing external data sources via the **Hydration Timeout Sandbox**. When a handler fetches data from Jira, Stripe, databases, or any external source and the call hangs, the framework enforces a strict deadline, unblocks the UI immediately, and returns a structured SYSTEM ALERT.

### Added

- **`HydrationSandbox` module** (`src/prompt/HydrationSandbox.ts`): Core timeout mechanism using `Promise.race`. Wraps handler execution with a strict deadline and catches both timeouts and handler errors, converting them to graceful `<hydration_alert>` XML-structured messages.
- **`hydrationTimeout` config** on `definePrompt()`: Per-prompt deadline in milliseconds. Example: `definePrompt('briefing', { hydrationTimeout: 3000, handler: ... })`.
- **`setDefaultHydrationTimeout(ms)`** on `PromptRegistry`: Global safety net for ALL prompts. Individual prompt timeouts override the registry default.
- **Three-scenario coverage**: Handler completes → normal result. Handler exceeds deadline → TIMEOUT alert. Handler throws → ERROR alert. The UI ALWAYS unblocks.
- **Timer cleanup**: `clearTimeout` via `finally` block — no resource leaks, no dangling timers keeping Node.js alive.
- **Zero overhead**: When no timeout is configured, no timer is created, no `Promise.race` wrapping — the handler runs directly.
- **Interceptor composition**: Prompt Interceptors still execute after a timeout, ensuring compliance headers and tenant context are always injected.
- **`getHydrationTimeout()`** on `PromptBuilder` interface: Read the configured timeout for introspection and testing.
- **17 new tests**: Unit tests covering timeout, early completion, error-as-degradation, timer cleanup, non-Error throws, plus integration tests for per-prompt config, registry defaults, override precedence, backward compatibility, and interceptor composition after timeout.

### Design Influences

- Go's `context.WithDeadline` (structured cancellation)
- gRPC deadline propagation (strict, per-RPC)
- Resilience4j TimeLimiter (JVM circuit breaker pattern)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-23

### Intent Mutex (Anti-Race Condition)

**Vurb.ts** now provides automatic transactional isolation for AI agents via the **Intent Mutex**. When an LLM hallucinates and fires identical destructive calls in the exact same millisecond (e.g., double-deleting a user), the framework serializes them to guarantee isolation.

### Added

- **`MutationSerializer` class:** Implements an idiomatic JS async mutex using per-key promise-chaining. Strict FIFO queue order without external locks, Redis, or OS primitives.
- **Zero-Configuration Setup:** Automatically enabled strictly for actions marked with `destructive: true`. Fast-path bypass for all other actions (zero overhead).
- **Per-Action Serialization:** `billing.refund` and `billing.delete` run independently, but concurrent `billing.refund` requests are strictly serialized.
- **Cooperative Cancellation:** Waiters queued in the mutex instantly abort if the request `AbortSignal` fires before they acquire the lock.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection:** Completed promise chains are aggressively pruned to prevent memory leaks.
- **Builder Integration:** Handled inside `_executePipeline` seamlessly; `GroupedToolBuilder` manages the mutex internally.
- **14 New Tests:** Unit tests covering chain GC, error recovery, signal abortion, parallel execution, and builder integration with other guards.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-23

### Runtime Guards — Concurrency Limiter & Egress Guard

**Vurb.ts** now provides two built-in runtime guards that fulfill the MCP specification requirement: *"Servers MUST rate limit tool invocations."* Both guards have **zero overhead** when not configured — no objects created, no branches in the hot path.

### Added

- **Concurrency Guard (Semaphore + Queue):** Per-tool semaphore with configurable `maxActive` concurrent executions and `maxQueue` backpressure queue. Load shedding rejects excess calls with `toolError('SERVER_BUSY')` — a structured error that guides the LLM to reduce its cadence.
  - `ConcurrencyGuard` class in `src/core/execution/ConcurrencyGuard.ts`
  - `.concurrency({ maxActive, maxQueue })` fluent method on `GroupedToolBuilder`
  - `ConcurrencyConfig` type exported from root barrel
  - AbortSignal integration: queued waiters are cancelled cooperatively
  - Slot release guarantee via `try/finally` — no leaks on handler crash
- **Egress Guard (Payload Limiter):** Per-tool maximum response size in bytes. Truncates oversized payloads at UTF-8 character boundaries and injects a system intervention message forcing the LLM to use pagination.
  - `applyEgressGuard()` function in `src/core/execution/EgressGuard.ts`
  - `.maxPayloadBytes(bytes)` fluent method on `GroupedToolBuilder`
  - `EgressConfig` type exported from root barrel
  - UTF-8 safe truncation via `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`
  - Minimum enforced at 1024 bytes to prevent unusable responses
- **`_executeWithObservability()` internal method:** Extracted from `execute()` to keep the concurrency/egress guard integration clean. No behavioral change — same tracing/debug/fast paths.

### Documentation

- **New "Runtime Guards" page (`docs/runtime-guards.md`):** Problem statement, architecture diagram, Quick Start for both guards, combined usage, testing patterns, MCP spec compliance section, configuration reference, and compatibility matrix.
- **VitePress sidebar:** Added Runtime Guards under Production section.
- **SEO:** 7 new FAQs for the Runtime Guards page with FAQPage + TechArticle JSON-LD structured data.
- **llms.txt:** Updated with Runtime Guards section and public API entries.

### Test Suite

- **24 new tests** in `RuntimeGuards.test.ts`:
  - ConcurrencyGuard: Semaphore Basics (3 tests)
  - ConcurrencyGuard: Backpressure Queue (3 tests)
  - ConcurrencyGuard: AbortSignal Integration (2 tests)
  - EgressGuard: Payload Truncation (5 tests)
  - Builder Integration: .concurrency() (5 tests)
  - Builder Integration: .maxPayloadBytes() (3 tests)
  - Runtime Guards: Combined (2 tests + abort scenario)
- **Test count:** 1,525 tests across 70 files, all passing.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🚫 Cancellation Propagation — Cooperative AbortSignal for MCP Tools

**Vurb.ts** now intercepts the `AbortSignal` from the MCP SDK and propagates it through the **entire execution pipeline** — middleware, handlers, and generators. When a user clicks "Stop" or the transport drops, all in-flight operations terminate immediately. Zero zombie processes. Zero resource leaks.

### Added

- **`extractSignal(extra)` in `ServerAttachment`:** Safely extracts `AbortSignal` from the MCP SDK's `RequestHandlerExtra` object. Returns `undefined` when not present (zero overhead).
- **`McpRequestExtra.signal`:** Extended interface to include `signal?: AbortSignal` from the SDK protocol layer.
- **`runChain()` cancellation gate:** Checks `signal.aborted` before invoking the pre-compiled middleware chain. Pre-cancelled requests return `error('Request cancelled.')` without executing any handler code.
- **`drainGenerator()` cancellation check:** Checks `signal.aborted` before each `yield` iteration. Aborted generators trigger `gen.return()` for `finally{}` cleanup, preventing zombie generators from continuing.
- **Signal propagation through the full pipeline:**
  - `RegistryDelegate.routeCall(ctx, name, args, sink, signal)`
  - `ToolBuilder.execute(ctx, args, sink, signal)`
  - `ToolRegistry.routeCall(ctx, name, args, sink, signal)`
  - `GroupedToolBuilder.execute(ctx, args, sink, signal)`
  - `_executePipeline(execCtx, ctx, args, sink, hooks, signal)`
  - `runChain(execCtx, resolved, ctx, args, sink, rethrow, signal)`
  - `drainGenerator(gen, sink, signal)`
- **`contextFactory` passthrough:** Developers can extract `extra.signal` in `contextFactory` and expose it as `ctx.signal` for use in `fetch()`, Prisma, and other I/O operations.
- **Loopback dispatcher propagation:** Prompts calling tools via `dispatchToolCall()` forward the signal to `registry.routeCall()`.
- **Flat exposition support:** Signal propagated in both grouped and flat exposition modes.

### Documentation

- **New "Cancellation" page (`docs/cancellation.md`):** Architecture diagram, Quick Start guide, generator cancellation, testing patterns, best practices (pass `ctx.signal` to I/O), and compatibility matrix.
- **VitePress sidebar:** Added Cancellation under Production section.
- **SEO:** 7 new FAQs for the Cancellation page with FAQPage + TechArticle JSON-LD structured data.

### Test Suite

- **9 new tests** in `CancellationPropagation.test.ts`:
  - Signal via contextFactory (1 test)
  - Pre-execution abort — handler never called (1 test)
  - Zero overhead — no signal present (1 test)
  - Generator abort — mid-iteration cancellation (1 test)
  - Generator abort — pre-aborted signal (1 test)
  - Flat exposition mode — signal propagated (1 test)
  - Direct builder execute — 4th parameter (2 tests)
  - Middleware chain — signal during middleware (1 test)
- **Test count:** 1,501 tests across 69 files, all passing.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-23

### 🧪 End-to-End Integration Test Suite

Comprehensive integration test suite (`tests/integration/FullStack.test.ts`) covering **all modules working together** through the MCP Server mock — happy paths AND sad paths. Ensures the framework resolves developer mistakes gracefully without crashing.

### Added

- **37 integration tests** in `FullStack.test.ts` organized across 22 `describe` blocks:

  **Happy paths (15 tests):**
  - Builder → Registry → Server → ContextFactory
  - Builder → Presenter → Server (auto-view composition)
  - Builder → Middleware → Debug Observability (cross-layer events)
  - Builder → Middleware → Tracing (OTel span lifecycle)
  - Builder → StateSync → Server (cache-control + invalidation)
  - PromptRegistry → Server (prompts/list + prompts/get)
  - Builder → Flat Exposition → Server (atomic tool projection)
  - Flat Exposition → Debug + Tracing (2 tests)
  - Full Stack — ALL modules in a single server attachment
  - Concurrent multi-tool calls (20 parallel + traced, 2 tests)
  - Presenter → Tracing → Server
  - Detach → Re-attach lifecycle
  - defineMiddleware → defineTool → Server

  **Sad paths (22 tests):**
  - **Routing Failures (4):** Unknown tool (`UNKNOWN_TOOL` + suggestions), unknown action, missing/null/empty discriminator, unknown flat tool name
  - **Validation Failures (3):** Wrong types, constraint violations (min/max/email), strict mode extra field rejection, flat mode validation
  - **Handler Exceptions (3):** Handler `throw` → `isError=true` (grouped + flat), soft fail vs hard fail tracing distinction (`UNSET` vs `ERROR` + `recordException`)
  - **Middleware Failures (3):** Middleware block + debug error event, middleware exception traced as system error, multi-middleware chain ordering (first blocker wins)
  - **Concurrent Mixed Results (1):** 5 simultaneous calls — 2 success + 1 validation error + 1 throw + 1 unknown action — isolated
  - **Debug + Tracing Error Correlation (2):** Debug error for unknown tool, traced validation error when both debug+tracing coexist
  - **defineTool Param Descriptor Errors (2):** Constraint violations via descriptors, shared param missing/empty
  - **StateSync Config Errors (2):** Invalid `cacheControl` directives rejected at attach time
  - **Detach Error Handling (2):** Post-detach calls return error, tools/list returns empty, double detach is idempotent

- **Mock strategy:** Only the MCP Server is mocked — no internal framework mocking. Tests exercise the full pipeline (routing → validation → middleware → handler → observability → response).

### Test Suite

- **1,492 tests** across 68 files, all passing.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-23

### 🛡️ XML Security & Error Protocol Hardening

Comprehensive security audit of the XML error protocol. Prevents XML injection, hardens type safety, and upgrades the registry-level error to the structured `toolError()` protocol.

### Security

- **XML injection prevention:** Introduced `escapeXml()` (element content — escapes `&` and `<`) and `escapeXmlAttr()` (attribute values — escapes all 5 XML special characters). Applied across `response.ts`, `ExecutionPipeline.ts`, `ValidationErrorFormatter.ts`, and `PromptExecutionPipeline.ts`.
- **Dual escaping strategy:** Element content preserves `>` for LLM readability (`>= 1`, `Must be > 0`). Attribute values use strict escaping.

### Fixed

- **Type safety in `parseDiscriminator`:** Replaced unsafe `as string` cast with runtime `typeof` check. Non-string discriminator values (numbers, booleans, objects) now return `MISSING_DISCRIMINATOR` instead of causing `TypeError: str.replace is not a function`.
- **Structured `UNKNOWN_TOOL` error:** `ToolRegistry.routeCall()` now returns `toolError('UNKNOWN_TOOL', ...)` with structured XML (code, message, available tools, recovery hint) instead of a freeform `error()` string. Consistent with pipeline-level errors (`MISSING_DISCRIMINATOR`, `UNKNOWN_ACTION`).

### Documentation

- **error-handling.md:** Added `UNKNOWN_TOOL` to the Unified XML Protocol table. Added XML Security tip callout.
- **llms.txt:** Added XML security note with pipeline error codes. Added `unknown_tool` to tracing error classification.

### DX

- **English error messages:** Translated remaining Portuguese error message in `defineTool.ts` to English.

### Test Suite

- **1,389 tests** across 417 suites, all passing.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🔗 MVA-Driven Prompts — `PromptMessage.fromView()`

Bridge the Presenter layer into the Prompt Engine with zero duplication. `PromptMessage.fromView()` decomposes a `ResponseBuilder` into XML-tagged prompt messages (`<domain_rules>`, `<dataset>`, `<visual_context>`, `<system_guidance>`) — same source of truth as the Tool response.

### Added

- **`PromptMessage.fromView(builder)`:** Static method that decomposes a `ResponseBuilder` into `PromptMessagePayload[]`. Extracts rules, validated data, UI blocks, hints, and action suggestions into semantically separated XML-tagged blocks optimized for frontier LLMs.
- **`ResponseBuilder` introspection getters:** `getData()`, `getRules()`, `getUiBlocks()`, `getHints()`, `getSuggestions()` — read-only access to internal layers without calling `.build()`.

### Documentation

- **`prompts.md`:** New H2 section "MVA-Driven Prompts — `fromView()`" with Before/After comparison, decomposition architecture diagram, XML tag table, composability example.
- **`presenter.md`:** New section "Using Presenters in Prompts" with cross-reference to Prompt Engine docs. Added Prompt Engine link to Next Steps.
- **`api-reference.md`:** New Prompt Engine section with `definePrompt`, `PromptMessage` (all methods), `PromptMessage.fromView()` decomposition table, `PromptRegistry` methods, and Prompt types.
- **VitePress sidebar:** Prompts section expanded from 1 to 5 items. Reference section expanded from 1 to 12 anchor-linked entries.
- **README.md:** Complete rewrite — engineering-focused documentation matching Prisma/tRPC style. Every section: 1-line technical description + code + output.
- **llms.txt:** Prompt Engine and MVA-Driven Prompts sections with examples. Public API expanded with 11 Prompt entries and 5 Prompt types.

### Test Suite

- **14 new tests** in `PromptMessageFromView.test.ts` covering rules decomposition, data extraction (JSON fencing), UI blocks, hints, suggestions, full composition, Presenter integration, and edge cases.
- **Test count:** 1,356 tests across 61 files, all passing.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### 💬 Prompt Engine — 100% MCP Spec Compliance

Full implementation of MCP `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` handlers with `definePrompt()`, `PromptMessage`, `PromptRegistry`, schema-informed coercion, middleware, tag-based filtering, and lifecycle sync (`notifications/prompts/list_changed`).

### Added

- **`definePrompt(name, config)`:** JSON-first prompt builder with flat schema constraint (primitives only — string, number, boolean, enum).
- **`PromptMessage`:** Factory methods — `.system()`, `.user()`, `.assistant()`, `.image()`, `.audio()`, `.resource()`.
- **`PromptRegistry<TContext>`:** Registration, tag-based RBAC filtering, `routeGet()` handler routing, `notifyChanged()` lifecycle sync, `attachToServer()`.
- **Schema-informed coercion:** Automatic string → number/boolean conversion based on declared schema types.
- **Flat schema constraint enforcement:** Nested objects/arrays rejected at definition time with actionable errors.
- **Middleware support:** Same `defineMiddleware()` chain as Tools — auth, RBAC, context derivation.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-23

### 🔀 Tool Exposition Strategies — Flat vs Grouped Topology Compiler

Two first-class exposition strategies for the same codebase: **flat** (one MCP tool per action — precision at action level) and **grouped** (one MCP tool per builder with discriminator enum — density at scale). Choose at attach time with `toolExposition: 'flat' | 'grouped'`. Same handlers, different wire format.

### Added

- **`ExpositionCompiler`:** New compile-time topology compiler that transforms builder action graphs into either flat atomic tools or grouped discriminator tools. Builds an O(1) routing map for flat mode dispatch.
- **`toolExposition` option in `AttachOptions`:** `'flat'` (default) expands each action into an independent MCP tool with isolated schema and annotations. `'grouped'` preserves the single-tool discriminator pattern.
- **`actionSeparator` option in `AttachOptions`:** Controls flat tool naming convention (default `'_'`). `projects` + `list` → `projects_list`.
- **MCP Annotation Refinement (`buildAtomicAnnotations`):** Annotations now follow correct MCP spec semantics:
  - Read-only actions → `{ readOnlyHint: true, destructiveHint: false }` (derived: read-only is never destructive)
  - Destructive actions → `{ destructiveHint: true }` (`readOnlyHint` omitted — spec default is `false`)
  - Normal actions → `{ destructiveHint: false }` (overrides spec default of `true` to prevent unnecessary safety warnings in Claude Desktop/Cursor)
  - `readOnlyHint: false` is never emitted (matches spec default)
- **Flat mode description synthesis:** Auto-generated descriptions tagged with `[READ-ONLY]` or `[DESTRUCTIVE]` prefixes, plus origin trail `(builder → action)`.
- **Flat mode StateSync integration:** Canonical dot-notation keys (`projects.create`) translate to/from flat wire names (`projects_create`) transparently.

### Documentation
- **New "Tool Exposition" page:** Stripe/Vercel-quality guide covering both strategies as equal peers, real-world SaaS admin example (10-action grouped), token math comparison, MCP annotation semantics callout, O(1) dispatch explanation, and decision guide table.
- **VitePress sidebar:** Added Tool Exposition under Core Concepts.
- **API Reference:** Updated `AttachOptions` with `toolExposition` and `actionSeparator` fields, added `ToolExposition` and `ExpositionConfig` type sections.
- **Routing page:** Cross-reference to Tool Exposition guide.
- **README:** Tool Exposition row in capability matrix and Learn by Doing guides table.
- **llms.txt:** Tool Exposition section with both strategies, MCP annotation semantics, and updated `AttachOptions` type.

### Test Suite
- **48 new tests** across 2 new test files:
  - `ToolExposition.test.ts` — 21 tests covering flat compilation, grouped passthrough, annotation isolation, hierarchical group expansion, multi-builder merging, separator customization, single-action builders.
  - `ToolExpositionSadPath.test.ts` — 27 sad-path tests covering builder-with-no-actions, empty separator, name collisions, schema shadowing, empty iterables, incorrect tool naming, mode confusion, detach/re-attach, late registration, custom discriminators, exception handling.
- **Test count:** 1,342 tests across 60 files, all passing.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🔭 Native OpenTelemetry-Compatible Tracing

Production-grade tracing for AI-native MCP servers. Every tool call creates **one span** with rich semantic attributes — zero dependencies on `@opentelemetry/api`, zero overhead when disabled. Uses structural subtyping: pass `trace.getTracer()` directly.

### Added

- **`VurbTracer` / `VurbSpan` interfaces:** Structural subtyping contracts that match the real OpenTelemetry `Tracer` and `Span` — no `implements` or `import @opentelemetry/api` needed.
- **`SpanStatusCode` constants:** Exported `UNSET` (0), `OK` (1), `ERROR` (2) matching OTel values.
- **`.tracing(tracer)` on builders:** Per-tool tracing via fluent API on both `createTool()` and `defineTool()`.
- **`enableTracing(tracer)` on `ToolRegistry`:** Propagate tracer to all registered builders.
- **`AttachOptions.tracing`:** Pass tracer to `attachToServer()` for full server observability.
- **Enterprise error classification:** 5 distinct `mcp.error_type` values (`missing_discriminator`, `unknown_action`, `validation_failed`, `handler_returned_error`, `system_error`) with correct `SpanStatusCode` mapping — AI errors → `UNSET` (no alert), system failures → `ERROR` (PagerDuty).
- **`mcp.isError` attribute:** Consistent `boolean` on all 5 error paths for unified Datadog/Grafana filtering.
- **Enterprise metadata attributes:** `mcp.tags` (tool tags for dashboard filtering), `mcp.description` (tool description), `mcp.response_size` (response text length for billing/quota).
- **Pipeline span events:** `mcp.route`, `mcp.validate` (with `mcp.valid` and `mcp.durationMs`), `mcp.middleware` (with `mcp.chainLength`). Events are optional via `?.` for minimal tracers.
- **Graceful error handling:** Handler exceptions are caught, span gets `SpanStatusCode.ERROR` + `recordException()`, but method returns error response (no MCP server crash).
- **Leak-proof span lifecycle:** `finally { span.end() }` guarantees span closure on all paths including exceptions.
- **Symmetric coexistence warning:** `enableDebug()` ↔ `enableTracing()` emit `console.warn` in either order when both are enabled.
- **`runChain(rethrow)` parameter:** Optional flag (default `false`) allows traced path to receive raw handler exceptions for proper classification.

### Changed

- **`runChain()` signature:** Added optional `rethrow` parameter (backward compatible, default `false`).
- **`_executeTraced()` error path:** Returns graceful `error()` response instead of `throw` — prevents MCP server crashes while preserving `SpanStatusCode.ERROR` for ops alerting.

### Documentation
- **New "Tracing" page:** Dedicated documentation page covering VurbTracer interface, error classification matrix, span attribute reference, pipeline events, context propagation limitation, and production setup example (OTLP/Jaeger).
- **VitePress sidebar:** Added Tracing under Advanced Guides.

### Test Suite
- **36 new tracing tests** in `Tracing.test.ts`:
  - Span lifecycle — creation, end, attributes (4 tests)
  - Span events — route, validate, middleware, order (5 tests)
  - Enterprise metadata — tags, description, response size (5 tests)
  - Error classification — OK, UNSET, ERROR with `mcp.isError` (5 tests)
  - Span leak prevention — finally guarantees (2 tests)
  - Zero overhead — fast path when disabled (2 tests)
  - Registry propagation — enableTracing() (2 tests)
  - Coexistence — debug + tracing symmetric warnings (3 tests)
  - addEvent optional, SpanStatusCode constants, defineTool compat (3 tests)
  - Multiple sequential calls, concurrent calls (2 tests)
  - Server attachment integration (1 test)
- **Test count:** 116 tests across Tracing + DebugObserver + McpServerAdapter, all passing.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🛡️ Agentic Error Presenter — LLM-Native Validation & Routing Errors

Validation and routing errors are now **formatted for autonomous agents**, not humans. When the LLM sends invalid arguments, it receives structured, uppercase, actionable correction prompts — with the exact field names, what was sent, what was expected, and a direct instruction to retry. The framework switches from `.strip()` to `.strict()`, meaning unknown fields now trigger **explicit rejection with field names** instead of silent removal.

### Changed

- **`.strip()` → `.strict()` in `ToolDefinitionCompiler.buildValidationSchema()`:** Unknown fields injected by the LLM are no longer silently discarded. They now trigger a validation error naming the unrecognized field(s) with a suggestion to check for typos. This gives the LLM a chance to self-correct instead of silently losing data.
- **`ValidationErrorFormatter` upgraded:**
  - New header: `⚠️ VALIDATION FAILED — ACTION 'X'` (uppercased for LLM visual parsing).
  - Anti-apology footer: `💡 Fix the fields above and call the tool again. Do not explain the error.`
  - Actionable hints per field with `You sent:` values and expected types/formats.
  - Unrecognized key errors include `💡 Check for typos` suggestion.
- **`ExecutionPipeline` routing errors:**
  - Missing discriminator: `❌ ROUTING ERROR: The required field 'action' is missing.` with available actions list and recovery hint.
  - Unknown action: `❌ UNKNOWN ACTION: The action 'x' does not exist.` with available actions list and recovery hint.

### Test Suite
- **1,254 tests** across 57 files, all passing.
- Updated assertions in 9 test files to match new error formats and `.strict()` behavior.

### 📡 Streaming Progress — End-to-End MCP Notification Wiring

Generator handlers that `yield progress()` now **automatically** send `notifications/progress` to the MCP client — zero configuration required. The framework detects `progressToken` from the client's request `_meta` and wires the notifications transparently. When no token is present, progress events are silently consumed with **zero overhead**.

### Added

- **MCP Progress Notification Wiring:** `ServerAttachment` now creates a `ProgressSink` from the MCP request `extra` object when the client includes `_meta.progressToken`. Each `yield progress(percent, message)` in a generator handler maps to `notifications/progress { progressToken, progress, total: 100, message }` on the wire. Fire-and-forget delivery — does not block the handler pipeline.
- **`ProgressSink` threading through the full pipeline:** `ToolBuilder.execute()`, `ToolRegistry.routeCall()`, `GroupedToolBuilder.execute()`, and `runChain()` all accept an optional `ProgressSink` parameter, allowing direct injection for testing and custom pipelines.
- **`McpRequestExtra` duck-typed interface:** New internal interface for extracting `_meta.progressToken` and `sendNotification` from the SDK's `extra` object without coupling to SDK internals.
- **`createProgressSink()` factory:** New private helper in `ServerAttachment.ts` that maps `ProgressEvent` to MCP wire format. Returns `undefined` when no token is present (zero overhead).
- **`isMcpExtra()` type guard:** Duck-type check for the MCP SDK's `extra` object.
- **`RegistryDelegate.routeCall()` signature updated:** Now accepts optional `progressSink` parameter.

### Documentation
- **Building Tools:** Streaming Progress section updated to explain automatic MCP notification wiring with wire format table.
- **API Reference:** `ProgressSink` type, MCP Notification Wiring subsection, updated `routeCall()` signature, and `attachToServer()` progress comment added.
- **Examples:** Streaming Progress example (§8) updated with a tip about automatic MCP notification wiring.

### Test Suite
- **8 new tests** in `ProgressWiring.test.ts`:
  - `builder.execute()` with `progressSink` — 3 tests (forward, backward compat, debug path).
  - `registry.routeCall()` with `progressSink` — 1 test (full routing pipeline).
  - MCP ServerAttachment integration — 4 tests (with token, without token, non-MCP extra, numeric token).
- **Test count:** 1,254 tests across 57 files, all passing.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🔍 Dynamic Manifest — RBAC-Aware Server Capabilities via MCP Resources

Expose a **live capabilities manifest** (`Vurb.ts://manifest.json`) as a native MCP Resource. Orchestrators, admin dashboards, and AI agents can discover every tool, action, and presenter registered on the server — dynamically filtered by the requesting user's role and permissions.

### Added

- **Dynamic Manifest Resource:** New opt-in MCP Resource (`Vurb.ts://manifest.json`) that exposes the full server capabilities tree. Uses native MCP `resources/list` and `resources/read` protocol — no custom HTTP endpoints. Zero overhead when disabled.
- **ManifestCompiler:** New `compileManifest()` function that extracts metadata from all registered `ToolBuilder` instances and produces a structured `ManifestPayload` with tools, actions, input schemas, and presenter references. `cloneManifest()` provides deep-clone isolation for RBAC filtering.
- **IntrospectionResource:** New `registerIntrospectionResource()` function that registers `resources/list` and `resources/read` handlers on the low-level MCP Server. Supports custom URIs, RBAC filter callbacks, and context factory integration.
- **RBAC Filtering:** Filter callback receives a deep clone of the manifest plus the session context (from `contextFactory`). Delete tools, actions, or presenters the user should not see. Each request gets a fresh clone — concurrent sessions with different roles never interfere.
- **Presenter Introspection Accessors:** `getSchemaKeys()`, `getUiBlockTypes()`, and `hasContextualRules()` on the `Presenter` class — read-only accessors that extract metadata without executing `.make()`, no side effects, don't seal.
- **`ActionMetadata` Presenter Fields:** Extended `ActionMetadata` with `presenterName`, `presenterSchemaKeys`, `presenterUiBlockTypes`, and `presenterHasContextualRules` for action-level presenter metadata.
- **`ToolRegistry.getBuilders()`:** New method returning an iterable of all registered `ToolBuilder` instances for introspection.
- **`AttachOptions.introspection`:** New `IntrospectionConfig<TContext>` option with `enabled`, `uri`, and `filter` fields.
- **`AttachOptions.serverName`:** New option to set the manifest's server name (default: `'Vurb.ts-server'`).

### Documentation
- **New "Dynamic Manifest" page:** Dedicated documentation page with full configuration guide, RBAC patterns, payload structure reference, architecture diagram, and real-world examples (multi-tenant RBAC, compliance audits, admin dashboards).
- **SEO:** 8 new FAQs for the Dynamic Manifest page with full structured data (FAQPage + TechArticle JSON-LD).

### Test Suite
- **50 new tests** across 2 new test files:
  - `Introspection.test.ts` — 31 tests covering ManifestCompiler, Presenter accessors, RBAC filtering, cloneManifest, ToolRegistry.getBuilders, ActionMetadata presenter fields.
  - `IntrospectionIntegration.test.ts` — 19 mock-based integration tests covering handler registration, resources/list and resources/read, RBAC with context factory, zero-overhead guarantee, custom URIs, concurrent reads, dynamic registry, and full payload structure.
- **Test count:** 1,246 tests across 56 files, all passing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-22

### 🎉 First Stable Release — MVA Architecture for AI-Native MCP Servers

This is the first stable release of `Vurb.ts`, introducing **MVA (Model-View-Agent)** — a new architectural pattern created by Renato Marinho at Vinkius Labs that replaces MVC for the AI era.

### Highlights

- **MVA Architecture:** The Presenter replaces the View with a deterministic perception layer — domain rules, rendered charts, action affordances, and cognitive guardrails. Every response is structured. Every action is explicit.
- **Presenter Engine:** `createPresenter()` with Zod schema validation, system rules (static & dynamic), UI blocks (ECharts, Mermaid, Summary), suggested actions (Agentic HATEOAS), cognitive guardrails (`.agentLimit()`), and Presenter composition via `.embed()`.
- **Action Consolidation:** 5,000+ operations behind ONE tool via `module.action` discriminator. 10x fewer tokens. Hierarchical groups with infinite nesting.
- **Two Builder APIs:** `defineTool()` (JSON-first, zero Zod imports) and `createTool()` (full Zod power). Both produce identical runtime behavior.
- **tRPC-style Middleware:** Pre-compiled at build time with `defineMiddleware()` for context derivation. Apply globally or per-group. Zero runtime allocation.
- **Self-Healing Errors:** `toolError()` with structured recovery hints and suggested retry arguments. AI agents self-correct without human intervention.
- **VurbClient:** tRPC-style end-to-end type safety with `createVurbClient<TRouter>()`. Full autocomplete, compile-time checking, zero code generation.
- **State Sync:** RFC 7234-inspired cache signals with `cacheSignal()` and `invalidates()` for cross-domain causal invalidation. Prevents temporal blindness.
- **Cognitive Guardrails:** `.agentLimit(n)` prevents context DDoS. Reduces token costs by up to 100x on large datasets.
- **TOON Encoding:** `toonSuccess()` reduces token count by ~40% vs standard JSON while remaining LLM-parseable.
- **Zero-Overhead Observability:** `createDebugObserver()` with typed events. Absolutely zero runtime cost when disabled.
- **Result Monad:** `succeed()` / `fail()` for composable, type-safe error handling with TypeScript type narrowing.
- **Streaming Progress:** Generator handlers with `yield progress()` for real-time updates.
- **Introspection:** `getActionNames()`, `getActionMetadata()`, `previewPrompt()` for runtime inspection and documentation generation.
- **Typed Handler Args:** `defineTool()` handlers receive fully-typed `args` inferred from params. No casts needed.
- **InferRouter:** Compile-time router type extraction with `InferRouter<typeof registry>`.
- **Freeze-After-Build:** `Object.freeze()` after `.buildToolDefinition()` ensures immutable, deterministic tool definitions.
- **Zod .strip() Security:** Only declared fields reach the AI. Internal fields silently removed.
- **Tag Filtering:** Role-based tool exposure per session without code changes.
- **Validation Error Formatter:** LLM-friendly Zod error messages with actionable correction guidance.

### Documentation
- **23 documentation pages** covering every feature with code examples and real-world patterns.
- **AEOS-optimized SEO:** 130+ unique FAQs across all pages as JSON-LD structured data, optimized for AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google SGE).
- **Per-page Open Graph, TechArticle, and FAQPage JSON-LD** via `transformHead` hook.
- **Global SoftwareSourceCode JSON-LD** with full metadata.
- **Comparison table** showing 20+ differentiators vs raw MCP.

### Test Suite
- **842 tests** across 36 files, all passing.
- Covers: invariant contracts, security vectors, adversarial inputs, schema collisions, concurrent stress, E2E integration, streaming, VurbClient contracts, and Presenter composition.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`InferRouter<typeof registry>` — Compile-Time Router Type Extraction (Task 2.1):**
  - New `createTypedRegistry<TContext>()` curried factory that creates a `ToolRegistry` while preserving builder types for compile-time inference.
  - New `InferRouter<T>` type utility that extracts a fully typed `RouterMap` from a `TypedToolRegistry`, producing `{ 'toolName.actionName': ArgsType }` entries with zero runtime cost.
  - New `TypedToolRegistry<TContext, TBuilders>` interface for type-safe registry wrapping.
  - `GroupedToolBuilder` now carries `TName` (literal tool name) and `TRouterMap` (accumulated action entries) as phantom generics — each `.action()` call widens the type with the new action's key and args.
  - `createTool()` now captures the tool name as a string literal type for inference.
  - 19 new tests covering runtime behavior + type-level inference verification.

- **Typed Handler Args via Schema Inference (Task 2.2):**
  - **`defineTool()` path:** `ActionDef` is now generic over `TParams`, so when `params: { name: 'string' }` is specified, the handler receives `args: { name: string }` — no casts needed. Works with shared params too: `args: InferParams<TParams> & InferParams<TShared>`.
  - **`createTool()` path:** Already supported via typed overload — verified with new compile-time tests.
  - Removed legacy double-cast pattern `(args as Record<string, unknown>)['message'] as string` from existing tests — `args.message` now works directly.
  - 6 new type-level tests verifying both `defineTool()` and `createTool()` paths.

### Changed
- **`GroupedToolBuilder` generics:** Expanded from `<TContext, TCommon>` to `<TContext, TCommon, TName, TRouterMap>`. Fully backward-compatible — all new generics have default values.
- **`ActionDef` generics:** Expanded from `<TContext, TArgs>` to `<TContext, TSharedArgs, TParams>`. Handler args are now conditionally typed based on params presence.
- **`ToolConfig.actions` / `GroupDef.actions`:** Changed from `Record<string, ActionDef>` to mapped types `{ [K in string]: ActionDef }` for per-action param inference.
- **Test count:** 842 tests across 36 files, all passing.


## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Sub-path export:** Added `"./client"` entry point in `package.json` exports so that the documented import (`Vurb.ts/client`) works natively.
- **Action Group Guard:** Added runtime guard in `defineTool()` throwing an error if both `actions` and `groups` are used simultaneously, aligning with `GroupedToolBuilder` mutual exclusivity.
- **Dead-code JSDoc stub:** Removed a malformed `export function defineTool(...)` stub that was incorrectly embedded inside the `defineTool` JSDoc text.
- **Type Safety & Strictness:** Resolved all remaining TypeScript lint errors across the core builders and schema generators (`no-explicit-any`, `strict-boolean-expressions`, and index signature properties). Removed `eslint-disable` escape hatches in favor of strict type inference using `infer` and pure TypeScript solutions.

### Added
- **API Parity (`omitCommon`):** `ActionDef` and `GroupDef` now accept `omitCommon?: string[]`, propagating it through `defineTool()` to the internal builders to match the builder API capability.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **`ValidationErrorFormatter`:** New pure-function module that translates raw Zod validation errors into LLM-friendly directive correction prompts. Instead of `"Validation failed: email: Invalid"`, the LLM now receives actionable guidance: `"❌ Validation failed for 'users/create': • email — Invalid email. You sent: 'bad'. Expected: a valid email address. 💡 Fix the fields above and call the action again."` Supports all major Zod issue codes: `invalid_type`, `invalid_string` (email, url, uuid, datetime, regex, ip), `too_small`/`too_big` (number, string, array, date bounds), `invalid_enum_value` (lists valid options), `invalid_literal`, `unrecognized_keys`, and `invalid_union`.
- **`omitCommon()`:** Surgical omission of common schema fields per action or group. Fields omitted are excluded from the LLM-facing schema and runtime validation. Supports per-action (`omitCommon: ['field']`) and group-level (`g.omitCommon('field')`) with automatic merge and deduplication.
- **`previewPrompt()`:** Build-time MCP payload preview with token estimate. Returns the full tool definition including generated description and schema, with an approximate token count for LLM context budgeting.
- **22 new tests** for `ValidationErrorFormatter` (17 unit + 5 integration).
- **18 new tests** for `omitCommon` covering flat/group/merge/edge cases.
- **Test count:** 819 tests across 35 files, all passing.

### Changed
- **`ExecutionPipeline.validateArgs()`:** Now delegates to `formatValidationError()` instead of raw `ZodIssue.message` joining. Backward-compatible — existing assertions on `'Validation failed'` still match.
- **SRP refactoring — `SchemaGenerator`:** Decomposed the monolithic `generateInputSchema` (120 lines, 4 responsibilities) into 5 focused helpers: `addDiscriminatorProperty()`, `buildOmitSets()`, `collectCommonFields()`, `collectActionFields()`, `applyAnnotations()`.
- **SRP refactoring — `ToolDefinitionCompiler`:** Extracted `applyCommonSchemaOmit()` — pure function for surgical Zod `.omit()` with empty-schema guard — from `buildValidationSchema()`.
- **SRP refactoring — `ActionGroupBuilder`:** Extracted `mapConfigToActionFields()` — shared `ActionConfig → InternalAction` mapper used by both `GroupedToolBuilder.action()` and `ActionGroupBuilder.action()`, eliminating 6-field duplication.
- **`InternalAction`:** Added `omitCommonFields?: readonly string[]` for runtime omission tracking.
- **`ActionConfig`:** Added `omitCommon?: string[]` to the public API.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Strict TypeScript flags:** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` enabled in `tsconfig.json`.
- **ESLint type-aware rules:** Added `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`, `await-thenable`, `require-await`, `no-unnecessary-condition`, `consistent-type-imports`, and `consistent-type-exports`. Upgraded `no-explicit-any` from `warn` to `error`.
- **`createIcon()` factory function:** Creates immutable `Icon` instances.
- **`createToolAnnotations()` factory function:** Creates immutable `ToolAnnotations` instances.
- **`createAnnotations()` factory function:** Creates immutable `Annotations` instances.
- **Edge-case test suite (`EdgeCases.test.ts`):** 37 new tests covering `getActionMetadata()`, group-level middleware chains, frozen guard on all config methods, error paths (non-Error throws, middleware errors), `ResponseHelper` empty-string fallback, `ConverterBase` null filtering, custom discriminator routing, and description generator edge cases.
- **Enterprise-grade test suites:** Added `InvariantContracts.test.ts` (56 tests: determinism, execution isolation, context immutability, handler chaos, unicode/binary boundaries, re-entrancy, concurrent registry stress, API equivalence, VurbClient contracts), `DeepVerification.test.ts`, `LargeScaleScenarios.test.ts`, `SecurityDeep.test.ts` (15 attack vectors), `McpServerAdapter.test.ts` (duck-type detection, detach lifecycle), `StreamingProgress.test.ts`, `EndToEnd.test.ts` (full-stack integration), and `ToonDescription.test.ts`.
- **Test coverage improved:** 773 tests across 33 files, 100% function coverage. Comprehensive invariant, security, and adversarial testing.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `Icon`, `ToolAnnotations`, and `Annotations` converted from mutable classes to `readonly` interfaces with factory functions (`createIcon()`, `createToolAnnotations()`, `createAnnotations()`). Use factory functions instead of `new Icon()`, `new ToolAnnotations()`, `new Annotations()`.
- **Converter API simplified:** `ConverterBase` abstract methods renamed from `convertFromSingle`/`convertToSingle` to `convertFrom`/`convertTo`. Domain-specific converter bases (`GroupConverterBase`, `ToolConverterBase`, etc.) no longer have redundant bridge methods — they directly extend `ConverterBase<DomainType, DtoType>`.
- **`ConverterBase.filter()`** now uses `NonNullable<T>` type predicate for better type narrowing in batch operations.
- **`BaseModel`** properties (`name`, `nameSeparator`) made `readonly`.
- **`InternalAction`** and **`ActionMetadata`** properties made `readonly` for immutability.
- **`ToolRegistry._builders`** map made `readonly`.
- All `import type` declarations enforced across the codebase via ESLint auto-fix.
- Removed unnecessary `async` from `ToolRegistry` detach handler (fixes `require-await`).
- Removed unnecessary truthy check in `GroupedToolBuilder._buildValidationSchema` (fixes `no-unnecessary-condition`).

### Fixed
- **Non-null assertions eliminated:** All `!` operators in `GroupedToolBuilder.ts` replaced with explicit guards and checks.
- **`McpServerLike` typing:** Replaced `any` with `never[]` for duck-typing safety in `ToolRegistry`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **`ConverterBase<TSource, TTarget>`:** Generic base class for all bidirectional converters. Consolidates the batch conversion logic (`map` + null filtering) that was previously duplicated across `GroupConverterBase`, `ToolConverterBase`, `PromptConverterBase`, `ResourceConverterBase`, and `ToolAnnotationsConverterBase`. Domain-specific converters now extend this base via bridge methods, eliminating the DRY violation while maintaining full backward compatibility.
- **`removeFromArray<T>()` utility:** Extracted duplicated `indexOf` + `splice` pattern into a reusable generic helper in `src/utils.ts`. Used by `GroupItem`, `Prompt`, and `Group`.
- **ESLint integration:** Added `eslint.config.js` (flat config) with `typescript-eslint` for type-aware linting. `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` scripts available.
- **`JsonSchemaObject` interface:** Typed the `zodToJsonSchema` output in `SchemaGenerator.ts`, eliminating raw `as Record<string, unknown>` casts.

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Java-style naming convention removed — all classes renamed to idiomatic TypeScript:
  - `AbstractBase` → `BaseModel` (file: `BaseModel.ts`)
  - `AbstractLeaf` → `GroupItem` (file: `GroupItem.ts`)
  - `AbstractConverter` → `ConverterBase` (file: `ConverterBase.ts`)
  - `AbstractGroupConverter` → `GroupConverterBase`
  - `AbstractToolConverter` → `ToolConverterBase`
  - `AbstractPromptConverter` → `PromptConverterBase`
  - `AbstractResourceConverter` → `ResourceConverterBase`
  - `AbstractToolAnnotationsConverter` → `ToolAnnotationsConverterBase`
  - `addLeaf()` / `removeLeaf()` → `addChild()` / `removeChild()` (private methods in `Group`)
- **BREAKING:** `ToolAnnotationsConverter` API normalized — method overloading removed. Use `convertFromToolAnnotation()` / `convertToToolAnnotation()` for single items, and `convertFromToolAnnotations()` / `convertToToolAnnotations()` for batch. Previous overloaded signatures no longer exist.
- **BREAKING:** `ToolAnnotationsConverterBase` abstract methods renamed from `convertFromToolAnnotationsSingle` / `convertToToolAnnotationsSingle` to `convertFromToolAnnotation` / `convertToToolAnnotation`.
- `success('')` now returns `'OK'` instead of an empty string — prevents confusing empty MCP responses.

### Fixed
- **`getGroupSummaries` dead field:** Removed unused `description` field from the return type — only `name` and `actions` were consumed.
- **Unused import:** Removed dead `z` import from `GroupedToolBuilder.ts`.
- **`ToolRegistry` typing:** Typed `callHandler` request parameter instead of `any`.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods removed from `BaseModel`. These were Java `Object` patterns with no runtime utility in TypeScript/JavaScript — use `===` for identity comparison.
- **BREAKING:** `toString()` methods removed from all domain model classes (`Group`, `Tool`, `Prompt`, `PromptArgument`, `Resource`, `Icon`, `ToolAnnotations`, `Annotations`). These used the Java `ClassName [field=value]` format — use `JSON.stringify()` or structured logging instead.
- Redundant null/undefined constructor guard removed from `BaseModel` — TypeScript strict mode handles this at compile time.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Domain model migrated from Java-style getter/setter methods to idiomatic TypeScript public fields. All `getX()`/`setX()` methods removed — use direct property access instead (e.g. `tool.name` instead of `tool.getName()`, `tool.title = 'Deploy'` instead of `tool.setTitle('Deploy')`).
- **BREAKING:** `getParentGroups()` and `getParentGroupRoots()` removed from `GroupItem`. Use `instance.parentGroups` directly; for roots use `instance.parentGroups.map(g => g.getRoot())`.
- **BREAKING:** `getChildrenGroups()`, `getChildrenTools()`, `getChildrenPrompts()`, `getChildrenResources()`, `getParent()`, `setParent()` removed from `Group`. Use `instance.childGroups`, `instance.childTools`, `instance.childPrompts`, `instance.childResources`, `instance.parent` directly.
- **BREAKING:** `Annotations` constructor parameters are now optional: `new Annotations()` is valid. Previously all three were required.
- `ToolAnnotations` empty constructor removed — class is now a plain data class with public fields.

### Fixed
- **Comma operator anti-pattern:** Replaced obscure `indexOf === -1 && (push, true)` pattern with readable `includes()` + explicit return in `GroupItem.addParentGroup()` and `Prompt.addPromptArgument()`.
- **Unused parameter removed:** `sb: string` parameter in `Group.getFullyQualifiedNameRecursive()` was a Java `StringBuilder` remnant — removed.
- **Dead import removed:** Unused `import { z } from 'zod'` in `ToonDescriptionGenerator.ts`.

### Documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` rewritten for new public-field API with usage examples.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **O(1) Action Routing:** Replaced `Array.find()` linear scan with `Map.get()` in `execute()`. The `_actionMap` is built once during `buildToolDefinition()` and reused across all invocations — fulfilling the README's O(1) performance promise.

### Added
- **Build-Time Schema Collision Detection:** `SchemaGenerator` now calls `assertFieldCompatibility()` to detect incompatible field types across actions at build time. The 3-layer check hierarchy detects base type mismatches (e.g. `string` vs `number`), enum presence conflicts (e.g. `z.enum()` vs `z.string()`), and enum value-set differences — while correctly treating `integer` as compatible with `number`. Throws actionable errors with field name, action key, conflicting types, and guidance.
- **`SchemaUtils.assertFieldCompatibility()`:** Extracted collision detection into `SchemaUtils` as a pure, reusable helper alongside the existing `getActionRequiredFields()`. Keeps `SchemaGenerator` focused on generation, not validation.
- **`SchemaCollision.test.ts`:** 50 dedicated tests covering all primitive type pairs, enum conflicts, integer/number compatibility, nullable edge cases, commonSchema vs action conflicts, hierarchical groups, multi-action chains, error message quality, and runtime behavior after valid builds.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `zod` moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` with range `^3.25.1 || ^4.0.0`. Projects using zod 4 no longer hit version conflicts.
- **BREAKING:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies`. Projects already have it installed — no duplication.

### Fixed
- GitHub URLs in `package.json` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` corrected from `vinkius-labs` to `vinkius-labs`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Scaling guide (`docs/scaling.md`) — technical deep-dive into how grouping, tag filtering, TOON compression, schema unification, Zod `.strip()`, and structured errors prevent LLM hallucination at scale.
- Link to scaling guide in README documentation table and Token Management section.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Core framework with `Tool`, `Resource`, and `Prompt` abstractions.
- `Group` class for logical organization of MCP capabilities.
- Discriminator-based routing for efficient tool selection.
- Strongly typed arguments and outputs using Zod.
- Initial project configuration and CI/CD setup.
- Basic documentation structure.
