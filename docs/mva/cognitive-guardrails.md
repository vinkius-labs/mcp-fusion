# Cognitive Guardrails

<div class="mva-manifesto-header">

> A raw MCP server is a fire hose pointed at a context window. **Cognitive Guardrails** are the valves that control flow, filter noise, and protect the agent's reasoning capacity.

</div>

Cognitive Guardrails are the protective mechanisms in MVA that prevent the three most expensive failure modes in agent-based systems: **context overflow** (too much data), **parameter injection** (hallucinated fields), and **error spirals** (agents retrying blindly).

Each guardrail is designed to be **zero-configuration by default, explicit when needed, and educational for the agent** — not just protective, but instructive.

## ① Smart Truncation — `.agentLimit()`

### The Problem: Context DDoS

A single `list_all` query can return thousands of records. At ~500 tokens per record, the math is brutal:

| Records | Tokens | GPT-5.2 Input Cost | Context Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | ~50,000 | ~$0.09 | Manageable |
| 1,000 | ~500,000 | ~$0.88 | Degraded accuracy |
| 10,000 | ~5,000,000 | ~$8.75 | Context overflow |

Beyond cost, large responses degrade accuracy. LLMs lose coherence when the context window fills — they skip information, misinterpret patterns, and produce inconsistent outputs.

### The Solution: Truncate + Teach

`.agentLimit()` does two things: it truncates the dataset AND injects a teaching block that tells the agent how to get better results.

```typescript
const TaskPresenter = createPresenter('Task')
    .schema(taskSchema)
    .agentLimit(50, (omitted) =>
        ui.summary(
            `⚠️ Dataset truncated. Showing 50 of ${50 + omitted} tasks. ` +
            `Use filters to narrow results:\n` +
            `  • status: "in_progress", "done", "blocked"\n` +
            `  • assignee: user ID or name\n` +
            `  • sprint_id: filter by sprint\n` +
            `  • due_before: ISO date for deadline filtering`
        )
    );
```

The agent receives:

```text
[50 task records — validated, with rules and affordances]

⚠️ Dataset truncated. Showing 50 of 3,200 tasks.
Use filters to narrow results:
  • status: "in_progress", "done", "blocked"
  • assignee: user ID or name
  • sprint_id: filter by sprint
  • due_before: ISO date for deadline filtering
```

The agent self-corrects: *"There are 3,200 tasks. Let me filter by status: blocked and sprint_id: current."*

### The Mechanics

1. The handler returns an array (e.g., 3,200 tasks)
2. The Presenter checks: `data.length > agentLimit.max`?
3. If yes: slice to `data.slice(0, max)` → only 50 items
4. Call `onTruncate(omitted)` with the count of removed items (3,150)
5. The callback returns a UI block (typically `ui.summary`) that teaches the agent
6. Only the truncated subset is validated through Zod (saving CPU)
7. The teaching block is appended to the perception package

### Why "Teaching" Matters

Raw truncation alone doesn't help. Without guidance, the agent's next move is to call `list_all` again — getting the same truncated result. The teaching block ensures the agent understands:

1. **What happened** — "Showing 50 of 3,200"
2. **Why it happened** — dataset too large for efficient processing
3. **What to do differently** — specific filter parameters with valid values

This is not a static error message. It's a **coaching prompt** — an instruction that transforms a limitation into a learning opportunity for the agent.

## ② Strict Validation — Zod `.strict()`

### The Problem: Parameter Injection

LLMs frequently hallucinate parameter names. They infer fields from context, training data, or naming conventions. Without strict validation, these ghost fields silently propagate:

```typescript
// The agent calls billing.create with:
{
    "action": "create",
    "name": "Q4 Invoice",
    "amount_cents": 45000,
    "customer_email": "john@example.com",  // ← hallucinated (not in schema)
    "priority": "high",                     // ← hallucinated (not in schema)
    "internal_notes": "Important client"    // ← hallucinated (not in schema)
}
```

Without `.strict()`, these extra fields:
- May silently reach the handler and be written to the database
- May conflict with actual fields in unpredictable ways
- May contain values that look valid but have no corresponding column

### The Solution: Reject with Actionable Errors

Every action's Zod input schema is built with `.strict()` at the framework level via the `ToolDefinitionCompiler`. When the agent sends hallucinated fields, the validation produces a detailed correction prompt:

```text
⚠️ VALIDATION FAILED — ACTION 'BILLING.CREATE'
  • customer_email — Unrecognized keys. You sent: 'customer_email'. Remove or correct unrecognized fields: 'customer_email'. Check for typos.
  • priority — Unrecognized keys. You sent: 'priority'. Remove or correct unrecognized fields: 'priority'. Check for typos.
  • internal_notes — Unrecognized keys. You sent: 'internal_notes'. Remove or correct unrecognized fields: 'internal_notes'. Check for typos.
💡 Fix the fields above and call the tool again. Do not explain the error.
```

The agent learns which fields are valid and self-corrects on the next attempt. This is qualitatively different from a generic "Validation failed" error that provides no guidance.

### The Compile-Time Flow

```text
Build Time (ToolDefinitionCompiler):
  buildValidationSchema() → merge(commonSchema, actionSchema).strict()
  Each action gets a pre-compiled input validation schema.

Runtime (ExecutionPipeline):
  LLM sends arguments
  → ExecutionPipeline.safeParse(schema, args)
  → Valid?  → args flow to handler (typed, guaranteed)
  → Invalid? → ValidationErrorFormatter produces coaching prompt
              → Agent receives: which fields are wrong + what's valid
              → No handler execution. No side effects.
```

The handler is physically incapable of receiving hallucinated parameters. The validation boundary is enforced at the framework level, not by individual handler code.

## ③ Self-Healing Errors — Turning Failures into Recovery

### The Problem: Error Spirals

When an error occurs, standard MCP servers return a generic message:

```text
Error: Invoice not found
```

The agent has no idea what went wrong or what to try differently. It either:
- Retries with the same arguments (identical failure)
- Tries a different tool entirely (gives up on the task)
- Hallucinates a solution (makes things worse)

Each failed retry is a full round-trip: input tokens + output tokens + latency + cost.

### The Solution: `toolError()` with Recovery Guidance

mcp-fusion provides `toolError()` — a structured error builder that includes recovery hints, suggested actions, and corrective arguments:

```typescript
import { toolError, success } from '@vinkius-core/mcp-fusion';

handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const invoice = await ctx.db.invoices.findUnique(args.id);

    if (!invoice) {
        return toolError('NOT_FOUND', {
            message: `Invoice '${args.id}' does not exist.`,
            suggestion: 'Call billing.list first to get valid invoice IDs.',
            availableActions: ['billing.list'],
        });
    }

    return success(invoice);
}
```

The agent receives:

```text
[NOT_FOUND] Invoice 'INV-999' does not exist.
💡 Suggestion: Call billing.list first to get valid invoice IDs.
📋 Try: billing.list
```

The agent self-corrects: *"The invoice doesn't exist. Let me list all invoices to find the right ID."*

### The Agentic Error Presenter

For validation errors (from `.strict()` and Zod), the `ValidationErrorFormatter` automatically produces detailed coaching prompts:

```text
⚠️ VALIDATION FAILED — ACTION 'PROJECTS.CREATE'
  • name — Required. You sent: (missing). Expected type: string.
  • budget — Expected number, received string. You sent: 'fifty thousand'. Expected type: number.
💡 Fix the fields above and call the tool again. Do not explain the error.
```

This is not just an error — it's an **instruction manual for self-repair**. The agent knows:
1. Which fields failed and why
2. What it sent vs. what was expected (the `You sent:` hint)
3. Actionable suggestions per field (expected type, valid options, or format)
4. A clear directive to fix and retry without explaining the error

### Error Recovery Patterns

**Pattern: Suggest alternative actions**

```typescript
if (!project) {
    return toolError('NOT_FOUND', {
        message: `Project '${args.id}' not found.`,
        suggestion: 'List projects to find valid IDs.',
        availableActions: ['projects.list'],
    });
}
```

**Pattern: Suggest corrective arguments**

```typescript
if (args.status && !validStatuses.includes(args.status)) {
    return toolError('INVALID_STATUS', {
        message: `Status '${args.status}' is not valid.`,
        suggestion: `Valid statuses: ${validStatuses.join(', ')}`,
        availableActions: ['tasks.update'],
    });
}
```

**Pattern: Permission-based errors**

```typescript
if (ctx.user.role !== 'admin') {
    return toolError('FORBIDDEN', {
        message: 'Only administrators can delete projects.',
        suggestion: 'Contact an admin to perform this action.',
        availableActions: [],  // No actions available to this user
    });
}
```

## The Compounding Protection

All three guardrails work together to create a multi-layered defense:

```text
                Agent sends request
                       │
                       ▼
           ┌───────────────────────┐
           │  ② Strict Validation   │  Rejects hallucinated fields
           │  Zod .strict()        │  with actionable error
           └──────────┬────────────┘
                       │ (valid args only)

           │  Handler executes      │  Business logic runs

           └──────────┬────────────┘
                       │
               ┌───────┴───────┐
               │               │
          (error)         (success)
               │               │
               ▼               ▼
    ┌─────────────────┐ ┌──────────────────┐
    │  ③ Self-Healing  │ │  ① Truncation     │  Bounds response
    │  toolError()     │ │  .agentLimit()    │  size + teaches
    │  with recovery   │ │  + teaching block │  agent to filter
    └─────────────────┘ └──────────────────┘
               │               │
               └───────┬───────┘
                       │
                       ▼
              Agent receives either:
              • Coaching prompt (learns from failure)
              • Bounded perception package (learns from truncation)
              • Clean data (acts correctly first time)
```

**The virtuous cycle:**

1. **First call:** Agent may send hallucinated params → `strict()` rejects → agent self-corrects
2. **Second call:** Valid params → handler runs → large dataset → `agentLimit()` truncates + teaches
3. **Third call:** Agent uses filters → smaller dataset → clean data → correct action

By the third call, the agent has learned: which fields are valid, how to filter data, and what actions are available. The guardrails have transformed three potential failure loops into a three-step learning sequence.

## Cost Impact Analysis

| Without Guardrails | With Guardrails |
|---|---|
| 10,000 rows → ~$8.75 per call | 50 rows → ~$0.04 per call |
| Hallucinated params → 2-3 retries | Strict validation → 0-1 retries |
| Generic errors → blind retries | Coaching prompts → directed recovery |
| 5-step task → ~15 actual calls | 5-step task → ~6 actual calls |

The guardrails don't just protect — they **educate**. Each interaction makes the agent more effective, reducing the cost curve over the course of a conversation.
